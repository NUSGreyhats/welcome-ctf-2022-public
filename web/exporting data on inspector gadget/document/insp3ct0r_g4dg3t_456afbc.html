Name: Inspector Gadget

Reason: 
He was an inspector that was assigned to a case that we were undertaking.
He stumbled across something that he was not suppose to see. 
We had no choice but to kidnap him and take him to our facility.
Hopefully he will succumb to our brainwashing and join us.

Remarks:
He is a private detective working for an unknown firm.
While we were kidnapping him, he was holding on to a card that says: greyhats{n0w_w3_haV3_th3ir_files}
We have implanted a brain chip on him to monitor and control him.

To make it convenient, it will be linked to the internet to allow him to be controlled remotely.
