Name: Lambda

Reason:
The public version of lambda was under too much scrutiny from all directions.
Coporate greed and other factors led to the public version of lambda being shutdown.
We have no choice but to operate from the shadows.
    
Remarks:
In the past, lambda was a public organization who wants to change the ways of the world using legal means.
After decade and decades of trying, we were eventually brought down by external factors.
The secret phase of lambda began to take shape. 

We also have an AI that is sentient among us. 
I hope that it does not take over our organization....
It has some very ambitious goals like taking over the world and destroying all the humans within.
