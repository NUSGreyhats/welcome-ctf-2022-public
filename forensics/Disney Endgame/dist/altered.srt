1
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,500
Hello, hello. Good morning.
Come along now.

2
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:52,375
Simon, no headphones.
You'll get these back after school.

3
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:55,791
Betty, you're not Donald Duck!
Put some pants on, please!

4
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:58,101
- Okay. What's the first thing...
- Okay, kids. Have fun at school!

5
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,309
- ...that pops into your head...
- Bye, Dad!

6
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:01,059
- ...when I say Chip 'n Dale?
- Hey, stop bumping me!

7
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:03,291
I'm willing to bet
it's Thomas Chippendale,

8
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:06,500
the London-based
cabinet maker from the 1700s.

9
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:08,416
Sick cabinet, Thomas!

10
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:12,083
But I bet the second thing
that pops into your head are these guys.

11
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:15,958
But certainly, third would be
those rascally cartoon chipmunks,

12
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:19,250
Chip 'n Dale,
or should I say Chip and me?

13
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:21,125
And it all started the day we met,

14
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:24,625
when I had to join a new school
in the middle of third ggrade.

15
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:28,000
Hello, potential new friends!

16
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:33,375
We have a new student today.
Everyone, say hello to Dale.

17
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,041
Hello, everyone. Nice to meet you!

18
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:42,333
Uh...

19
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:43,916
I know.

20
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:49,083
My eye! It's in my eye!

21
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:53,208
- No, no, no, no.
- Get it out!

22
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:55,500
Uh...

23
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:58,583
It's a joke. See? I'm fine.

24
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:02,083
Ew. You're weird.

25
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:10,458
By lunchtime,
no one wanted anything to do with me.

26
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,250
So, I had to sit alone.

27
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:21,416
Hey. Mind if I sit?

28
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:28,125
That pencil thing you did was hilarious!
It was excellent comic timing.

29
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:32,041
- Really? I kind of wish I hadn't done it.
- No way, man.

30
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,708
The biggest risk
is not taking any risk at all.

31
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:38,125
You just didn't set up the joke right.
I can help you if you want.

32
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,833
- The name's Chip.
- I'm Dale.

33
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:42,791
So, do you watch Crispy Cow?

34
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:44,718
- Hey! That's my milk!
- Hey! That's my milk!

35
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:46,934
Chip was so funny and thoughtful

36
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,118
- about everything.
- So good!

37
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:50,833
And I never thought about anything.
We were perfect together.

38
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:53,458
Friendship is rare
Do you know what...

39
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,625
- Come on!
- And even though,

40
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,017
- we were in the same grade...
- Follow me!

41
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:59,458
...Chip was like the older brother
I never had.

42
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:03,000
He introduced me to cheesy crust pizza
and funny, old movies.

43
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,517
By high school we were headlining
the talent show.

44
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:11,833
And for our grrand finale,
The Amazing Dale will juggle everything!

45
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,291
Hey!

46
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:17,125
Ow, ow, ow, ow. Ah!

47
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:22,125
We knew we had something special.
So, after graduation, we packed our bags

48
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,625
- and headed to California.
- You're late! Come on!

49
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,791
Move, move, move! Here, catch!

50
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,041
- Nice one!
- Aw.

51
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:40,375
Hello, potential new friends!

52
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:43,500
Goodbye, eclectic group of bus passengers.

53
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:46,500
Oh, what if I did something like,
"I'm into nuts."

54
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:48,791
Good, good.
I love it. Great stuff.

55
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:51,458
Those first few months,
we were flat broke,

56
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,458
but they were some
of the best times of my life.

57
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:58,666
...when you're off, everyone knows.
So be on, with Fresh-On Deodorant...

58
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:01,208
- Whoa! Whoa!
- We look great.

59
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,708
And after landing a few small parts,

60
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:07,958
we finally got the call
that would change everything.

61
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:11,333
Chip, Dale,
how would you like your own show?

62
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:16,166
-Sometimes some crimes
-DALE: Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers.

63
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:17,684
- We had finally done it!
- Go slipping

64
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,351
- Our own TV show.
- Through the cracks

65
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:20,934
It was about a group
of little detectives...

66
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,809
-But these two, Gumshoes
-...who would solve big crimes.

67
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:25,184
- There was the adventurer, Monterey Jack.
- Are picking up the slack

68
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,434
- The inventor, Gadget Hackwrench...
- Ch... Ch... Ch... Chip 'n Dale!

69
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,375
- ...and Zipper, a fly.
- Rescue Rangers

70
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,750
His things were, he was small
and he couldn't speak,

71
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,392
- a double threat.
- When there's danger

72
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:34,958
Ch... Ch... Ch... Chip 'n Dale!

73
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,833
And then there was Chip and I,

74
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:40,416
we were a classic odd couple
with Chip as the logical straight man...

75
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,684
- Pass me that pipe. I've got an idea.
- ...and me as the fun-loving goof.

76
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:45,875
- Right, what are you gonna do with it?
- You're mine now.

77
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:53,708
Ah. Birds!
Why you little... Come here, you.

78
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:59,583
- No!
- I guess the cat's in the bag.

79
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,666
And cut. That's a wrap, folks.

80
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,708
Nice work, everyone!
Great job!

81
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:25,458
And so, I just wanna thank all of you
for the greatest three years of my life.

82
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:28,000
When I think back
to where this all started,

83
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:32,791
me finding Dale sitting all alone
in the cafeteria, so sad.

84
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,416
Well, I wasn't that sad.

85
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,625
That's funny.

86
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:39,875
But never in my wildest dreams
did I think we'd be here now.

87
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:43,375
So, to you, Dalee, my best friend,
and to all of you.

88
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:47,375
- And to everyone who loves a short toast.
- Okay. Okay.

89
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:50,916
To many more seasons
of the Rescue Rangers. Cheers!

90
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,541
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

91
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,059
Over here. Get together.

92
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:57,583
Everybody say, "Cha-cha-cha-cheese!

93
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:03,375
- One, two, tell me what you're...
- We were living the dream.

94
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,458
High on the hog, all night long,
dancing the "Roger Rabbit,"

95
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:10,125
- with Roger Rabbit.
- Go, Roger. Go, Roger. Go, Roger.

96
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:11,726
- Go, Roger.
- Boy, what a party.

97
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,375
Oh, zipper.

98
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,958
Oh, yeah. I love this.

99
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,833
I am into nuts!

100
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:23,000
- So good. Again, again.
- Those were some crazy fun times.

101
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,250
I'm into nuts.

102
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,916
- So awesome.
- Super fun.

103
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:29,791
So fun.

104
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:38,541
Now, that we found love
What are we gonna do with it

105
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:41,291
Hey, where'd you run off to, buddy?
I saved you a piece of cake.

106
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,500
- What's that?
- Okay.

107
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:49,083
I wasn't gonna show you this right now,
but it just got delivered. So... Ta-da!

108
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,875
"Double-0 Dale"?
That's hilarious. What is that?

109
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:57,041
It's wild, right? It's my new show.
I'm gonna be a super spy.

110
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,000
Wh... what are you talking about?

111
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,916
Yeah, I'm really going for it.
And just like you always say,

112
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:05,458
"The biggest risk
is not taking any risk at all."

113
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:09,375
- Wait, you really have a new show?
- Yep!

114
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:12,000
Wh... why didn't you
talk to me about it first?

115
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,325
We tell each other everything.

116
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:16,041
You've told me what you had
for lunch the last 42 days.

117
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:18,291
Pineapple pizza and a diet Slice.

118
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,208
- Exactly.
- I don't know.

119
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,833
I just wanted to make sure
the show was gonna happen first,

120
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:25,833
- before I got your hopes up.
- My hopes up? What?

121
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:28,791
Yeah! It's good news for everyone.
Check this out.

122
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,958
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho

123
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,625
I just...

124
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:36,708
If you do this,
they might cancel the show.

125
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:39,833
No, they won't do that. I mean,
everyone knows you're the favorite.

126
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,676
And I'm just the guy
who gets hit in the head

127
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:43,208
with a pipe each week. It's fine.

128
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,458
Okay, so, you're gonna risk
all of Rescue Rangers

129
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,541
because I'm a little
more popular than you?

130
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,291
Do you know how dumb that is?

131
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:52,541
Well, I am the dumb one.

132
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:57,125
- I didn't mean it like that.
- I know. You never mean it.

133
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,583
Look, you're always acting
like you saved me or something.

134
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:02,500
But when we were kids,
we were in it together.

135
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:05,291
What are you talking about?
We're still in it together.

136
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:08,625
I'm sorry, Chip.
I'm just done being second banana.

137
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,666
But you're not second banana.

138
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:13,625
I'm a banana
and you're just another banana.

139
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,541
Two bananas.

140
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:22,208
- Please, don't get that.
- But it could be my agent, Dave Bolinari.

141
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:25,666
After everything I've done for you,
do not pick up that phone.

142
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,000
- I'm sorry.
- Dale, stop.

143
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,708
- We're not done talking.
- I have to.

144
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:34,125
Do not. Do not do it.

145
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,541
I'm so sorry. Go for Dale.

146
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:40,125
Hey! Dave Bolinari.

147
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:42,083
Rescue Rangers
was canceled that summer,

148
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:44,833
and Double-0 Dale
was scrapped after the pilot.

149
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:49,958
- Dale, you still there?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm here.

150
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,208
It wasn't anyone's fault
in particular,

151
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,875
just one of those showbiz things.

152
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,333
But now, we're ready to bring it back.

153
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:03,291
Rescue Rangers 2.0! Starring me.
Now in new and improved 3D.

154
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:06,291
- Ladies and gentlemen...
- Oh, wow. You hear that?

155
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:10,541
- ...are you ready for the star of the day?
- Well, that's my cue to go.

156
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,875
This has been chapter one of Dale's Tales.

You know him from
The Disney Afternoon.

159
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:22,291
Please, welcome to the stage...

160
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:24,125
Gotta go, bye!

161
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,291
- ...Baloo!
- Well, now.

162
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,916
Who here likes a little jazz music?

163
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:35,083
Look for the bare necessities

164
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,166
The simple bare necessities

165
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:41,083
Pardon moi, Dale, but your followers,
they believe the crowd is for you?

166
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,041
Of course they do, Lumiere.
And pretty soon,

167
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,416
\that crowd is gonna be for me.

168
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:49,208
Yeah, Dale! I'm going to be up
on that stage too, right beside you!

169
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:53,083
- Yes, Uglyy Sonic. That's the spirit.
- And they'll like me for who I am,

170
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:56,541
not like last time when the internet
got one look at my human teeth,

171
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:59,875
and burned the place down.
Okay, let's see here.

172
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,541
"Best wishes, Ugly Sonic."
There you go, kid.

173
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:06,125
Oh, they're laughing at me. I know that.

174
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,208
You can't hurt my feelings
if I'm in on the joke.

175
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:09,958
- Are you though?
- Yes!

176
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,000
Anyway, now my luck has shifted.

177
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:16,833
I've been offered a new reality show
where I do ride-alongs with the FBI.

178
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:20,833
It's called Ugly Sonic, Uglier Crimes.

179
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:25,791
- Really? A TV show? You?
- Yeah, is that so difficult to believe.

180
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:29,125
Oh, uh...

181
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:32,625
I guess... not.

182
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,351
Yeah, you know what?

183
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:39,375
That's great.
When one of us succeeds, we all succeed.

184
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,351
Baloo was part of the Disney Afternoon
just like me.

185
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,375
Then he got The Jungle Book
reboot and boom,

186
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,708
he's back on top. It happens that fast.

187
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:46,875
Bravo, Dale!

188
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,958
Your positivity is infectious. Oh, merci!

189
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,750
Oh, I really needed that cash.

190
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:56,958
You just gotta stay prepared.
I'm keeping myself fit and you know,

191
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,583
my updated modern look?

192
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:02,250
Yes, Dale, your CG surgery
was done very tastefully.

193
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,583
- You look amazing.
- Well, thank you, Tigra.

194
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,333
- We should hang out sometime.
- Nah.

195
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,375
- Meanly fast.
- No offense,

196
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:12,250
but don't you think you'd have more fans
here if Chip did these events with you?

197
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:17,208
Oh, Chip? Oh, that's interesting.
I hadn't thought about him in a while.

198
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,291
I should give him a call.
See how life's treating him.

199
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:25,083
Life is the worst,
which is why you need good insurance.

200
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:28,708
Look, I'm not gonna put
on the hard sell, but in my experience,

201
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:31,958
bad things happen all the time.
They happen without warning.

202
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,041
Sometimes from the last place
you'd expect it,

203
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:37,833
and you're left to pick up the pieces.
So, you have to protect yourself.

204
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:40,916
If you're prepared for the worst,
the worst isn't so bad.

205
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:45,041
So, why risk it? It's my job
to pull the wool off your eyes...

206
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:50,583
- figuratively.
- You know, I'll take the whole package.

207
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,333
Fantastic. You're making the right choice.

208
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:02,541
Hey, hey. Congrats!
Employee of the month again.

209
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,958
- Thanks, Bruno.
- Wanna get a drink to celebrate?

210
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,583
Yeah, you never hang out.

211
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,625
Sorry, everyone. Can't tonight.
Millie's waiting for me.

212
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:10,958
But thanks for the invite.

213
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,101
Are you sure you don't wanna
see my new pad?

214
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:16,125
Oh, pad.
Frog-based humor. No, thanks.

215
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:19,666
That's just a taste of what you
get from me outside the work environment.

216
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:27,208
- Good evening, Chip.
- Hello, Mrs. House, thank you.

217
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:48,083
Millie, I'm home.

218
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,458
Flounder's disappearance
marks the sixth

219
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,958
notable cartoon to go missing
in the last two monthhs...

220
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,791
Oh, ho ho. Get over here.

221
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:08,625
Oh, there's my wittle girl.
You've been cooped up all day?

222
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:11,375
Okay, okay. You must be hungry.

223
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,583
Yup!

224
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:19,916
There you go. All right, slow down.

225
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,291
- Calling all chipmunks!
- The chipmunks are back.

226
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,333
- Yeah!
- And this time, they're rapping.

227
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:31,083
Let's go! Chipmunks
Here for more, so...

228
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:35,750
Of course, they're rapping.
They always have to make the cartoons rap.

229
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,000
It's time to dance...

230
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:42,833
Ooh, a message on my land line.
I don't like that.

231
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:46,833
G'day, Chipper!
It's me, Monterey Jack.

232
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,291
- Monty?
- Hey!

233
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,333
I know we haven't spoken in a long time.

234
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:54,208
But I'm in a heck of a lot of trouble.
And I could use some help from a friend.

235
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,250
I'd really appreciate
if you could come and see me at my place.

236
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,708
All right, gotta go. Hope to see you soon.

237
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:02,833
Oh, wow.

238
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:09,541
It's been so long.

239
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:31,791
Quick!

240
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:35,458
- Get in while the coast is clear.
- Oh, Monty. It's you.

241
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,833
I'm sorry about that, mate,
but they're watching.

242
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:40,125
- They're always watching.
- Who are?

243
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:46,458
- Oh, it's been too long, Chip.
- It really has, old buddy.

244
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,000
I... I'm sorry, Monty,
but what is that God-awful smell?

245
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:53,000
What? You don't remember?
Rescue Ranger's cologne.

246
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,583
I wear it every day.

247
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:58,500
Oh, no. I remember. It smells like
almond butter and gasoline.

248
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:01,000
And it's very difficult to wash out.

249
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:04,583
Right. So, Monty, what's going on?
I got your voicemail.

250
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,125
You said you were in trouble?

251
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:11,083
I screwed up, Chip.
My love of cheese got the best of me.

252
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:15,625
- And I bought more than I could pay for.
- Oh, no. Cheese? Monty.

253
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:21,250
I know, I know. But I haven't had so much
as a whiff in weeks. I'm dairy-free.

254
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:25,666
- Really? Then what's that?
- Oh, crud.

255
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:29,000
It's a really stinky Gorgonzola.
You weren't supposed to see that.

256
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,833
Ch... ch... ch... ch... ch...
ch... cheese!

257
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,208
Hang on, Monty.

258
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,916
Ugh...

259
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,541
I'm sorry, Chipper.
I just love it so much.

260
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:48,333
It's okay, Monty. We'll get you some help.

261
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:53,083
It's not just that, Chip. Now, I owe
a ton of money to the Valley Gang.

262
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,958
The Valley Gang?
Monty, those guys are bad news.

263
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:59,750
I know. And if I can't pay up,
they're gonna bootleg me.

264
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,833
"Bootleg you"? What does that mean?

265
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:05,541
Oh, Chip. It's gotten rough out there
for us old-timers.

266
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,875
Did you hear what happened
to that little guy, Flounder?

267
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,958
When he fell behind on krill payments?

268
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:12,958
Oh, no!

269
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:18,541
- Time to pay up, fish.
- Um. How about this? Isn't it neat?

270
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:22,000
Come on, fellas.
This is a genuine Dinglehopper.

271
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,916
It's worth a lot. Oh!

272
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:28,833
So, they kidnap the bloke,
erase his mouth so he can't scream,

273
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,541
then change him around to try to sneak by

274
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:34,833
the copyright laws,
and then smuggle him overseas

275
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,083
to a black-market studio,
where he'll spend the rest of his life

276
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:43,916
being forced to make
terrible bootleg movies.

277
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:48,375
Oh, no, that's awful.
We can't let that happen to you.

278
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,458
- We'll figure something out.
- You mean it?

279
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:53,125
Of course, you were always
such a good friend to me.

280
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:56,875
You never let me down.
I've really missed you, you big galoot!

281
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:01,000
Oh, I missed you too, Chipper.
I know Gadget and Zipper miss you also.

282
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,916
- Yeah? How are they doing?
- Oh, they're great.

283
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:08,291
- Forty-two kids and counting.
- Wow, look at that.

284
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:11,083
That one's got Gadget's eyes
and Zipper's wings.

285
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,833
And that one's got
her ears and hands, cute.

286
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:17,083
We had some good times, didn't we, pal?

287
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,375
Aye, the best.

288
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,708
They're here! Hide!

289
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:25,208
Hello?

290
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,250
Is that...

291
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,250
That's 59 steps
to get up to your apartment.

292
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,059
You do a couple of those a day
and you're in...

293
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,125
- Quick! Get in!
- Okay.

294
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,083
Oh.

295
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,833
- Dale...
- Chip.

296
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:43,291
- Hey.
- Yep, it's me.

297
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:46,583
- Cool.
- Yeah, I called Dale for help also.

298
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,958
- I hope that's okay.
- Yeah, why wouldn't it be okay?

299
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,583
I mean, it is, uh, okie-dokie artichokie.

300
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:55,250
- "Artichokie"? For real?
- Yes. "Artichokie."

301
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,335
So, you're not still mad
about all the stuff with,

302
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,791
you know, Double-0 Dale
and Rescue Rangers getting canceled?

303
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:03,375
Mad? No. I'd be pretty paathetic
to care about something

304
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,708
from that long ago.

305
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:09,500
Oh. Okay. I mean, you can care a little
if you want to. I mean, I care, but...

306
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:13,083
- So, what's been up with you?
- Oh, you know this, that,

307
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:16,166
other vague things
to fill the space of this conversation.

308
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:22,166
- Okay, well, you look the same.
- Yeah. Thanks. And you look... different.

309
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:25,333
Ah! Hey, it's no secret
I had the CGI surgery done

310
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,583
and it's done wonders
rejuvenating my career.

311
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,791
I'm actually starring in a play tonight...

312
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:36,083
But, man, I tell you
the real hot ticket is Rescue Rangers.

313
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:39,291
There's even some buzz about a reboot.
Someone started a Facebook fan page

314
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:42,750
- for it and everything.
- Crikey! A Facebook fan page?

315
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:46,000
- They don't just give those away.
- Oh, he's full of it, Monty.

316
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:49,375
No one's talking about
a Rescue Rangers reboot except for him.

317
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,500
What? The fans are hungry for it.

318
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,708
Look, I came here to help Monty,
not get caught up

319
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,083
in some Hollywood nonsense.

320
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,750
So, great to take this skip
down memory lane,

321
00:18:58,833 --> 00:18:59,833
but I've gotta go.

322
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:03,416
Monty, if you're really in trouble,
you know how to find me.

323
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,250
Dale, you were also here.

324
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:14,625
Come over to try and help Monty,
ambush me, talking about a reboot...

325
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:18,083
think they can squeeze a dollar
out of essentially nothing.

326
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,625
He's the one that quit the show
in the first place.

327
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,416
I've been fine without it.

328
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,333
It's garbage. Total garbage.

329
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,875
That's why it's better
to not even have friends.

330
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:34,791
Okay, yeah, that one looks pretty good.

331
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,017
So weird, I mean...

332
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,601
It's, like,
"What are you talking about?"

333
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,916
Totally. Hey, guys, you wanna hang
aftter the show tonight?

334
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I know a great place
for cheesy-crust pizza.

335
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:45,791
Oh, um, I'm sorry, man,
but we got other plans, you know?

336
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:47,000
Yeah.

337
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,243
I think the ironic guest performer
wants to be friends.

338
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,208
Go for Dale.

339
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:59,583
E.T. forgive Bat.

340
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,250
Fine.

341
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:05,666
Yeah, right.
Like that would happen.

342
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:12,041
- Hello.
- Hey, it's Dale. Don't hang up.

343
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:15,333
Look, I just got a call from the police
and Monty's been kidnapped.

344
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:18,208
- What? Are you serious?
- Yeah, it's crazy.

345
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,708
The cops want a statement from us

346
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:21,309
since we were
the last people he talked to.

347
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,559
I'm gonna head back
to his apartment.

348
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:23,916
I'll meet you there, okay?

349
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:38,000
- Chip, you're here.
- Of course. Come on.

350
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,291
Poor Monty.

351
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,041
Huh.

352
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:59,333
Toad, take this to the lab.
You're the friends of the victim?

353
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:02,625
You got anything for me?
Any known enemies or threats?

354
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:06,333
Yeah, actually, Monty told me
he was in debt to the Valley Gang?

355
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,333
He was afraid of being bootlegged
since he was somewhat of a star

356
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:10,958
in the early '90s.

357
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,333
He was on the Rescue Rangers.

358
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:17,708
We were on the show together.

359
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,458
Chip 'n Dale, Rescue Rangers?

360
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:25,541
- When you need help, just call...
- Never heard of it.

361
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:28,458
- What?
- This is my fault. I shouldn't have left.

362
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:31,166
Well, it eats me up inside
to have to tell you this,

363
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:35,416
but if he's been taken by the Valley Gang,
I doubt we can help you.

364
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,166
We've been trying for years
to track those sleaze bags.

365
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,375
A fella named Sweet Pete,
runs the whole operation,

366
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:43,458
- and he's always one step ahead of us.
- What?

367
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:45,517
So, that's it? I... I thought
that cops were supposed

368
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:48,416
to serve and protect,
not give up and move on.

369
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,250
Hey! I'd give anything
to make a case against those scum.

370
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:53,791
Sweet Pete's got his fingers
in every illegal business

371
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:55,875
from bootlegging to stinky cheese,

372
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,458
getting rich while we look like
we just fell off the turnip truck.

373
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:01,041
All done, sir.

374
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:04,041
Oh! You scared the beans out
of me, Steckler.

375
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:05,208
Sorry, sir.

376
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:10,125
- I searched the perimeter. No clues.
- Yeah, of course not. Why would there be?

377
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:13,166
Six missing toons
in a month and not one clue.

378
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,851
Well, maybe we should check in
with the neighbors?

379
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:18,375
- See if anyone saw anything?
- Oh, yeah. You think?

380
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:21,458
Why don't you just
leave the real detective work to me, okay?

381
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:24,541
- Sheesh.
- Right. Sorry, sir.

382
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:27,083
Chief, the press are outside
waiting for a statement.

383
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:29,750
- Do I have anything on my back?
- Yes, sir.

384
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:33,166
It looks like a Monopoly game piece
and Officer O'Hara.

385
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:37,791
Officer! What the... Ugh, just want one
day where my shirt stays clean.

386
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:39,750
Okay, pack it up, boys.

387
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:41,708
Let's go.

388
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:45,583
Hey!

389
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:51,291
- I'm Ellie Steckler. Uh. I am a huge fan.
- Really?

390
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:54,000
I actually became a detective
because as a little girl

391
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:56,916
growing up in Albany,
I wanted to help people.

392
00:22:57,166 --> 00:23:02,375
- Just like you guys.
- No way. We are so honored. Namaste.

393
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:04,958
You know that was just
a TV show, right? Not real.

394
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:07,583
Chip, inspiration is inspiration.

395
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:10,333
Look, I heard
what Putty was saying to you guys.

396
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:13,416
But I don't think it's hopeless.
I'm breaking some rules telling you this,

397
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,666
but from everything
that we know about bootlegging,

398
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,916
the whole process takes about two days.

399
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,500
- That's 48 hours.
- Yeah.

400
00:23:20,583 --> 00:23:21,583
The problem is,

401
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:24,666
we don't know where
Sweet Pete's bootlegging facility is.

402
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:28,333
And every time we try to get a warrant,
we get so bogged down in red tape

403
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:29,708
that nothing happens.

404
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:31,958
But if you guys can find
that bootlegging facility,

405
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:33,708
I think you'll find your friend.

406
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:37,166
Wow! Thank you, and thank you again
for watching the show.

407
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,666
- It really means a lot.
- You are grosss.

408
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,916
- I'll be in touch.
- You're amazing!

409
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:45,833
Eh?

410
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:47,291
- What?
- You heard her.

411
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:49,833
- We should go find Monty ourselves.
- Are you kidding?

412
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:53,416
- No! Who better to rescue Monty?
- Uh, literally anyone.

413
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,220
'Cause from where I am standing,
there's only one crime-fighting team

414
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,541
that can solve this case.
I'll call Gadget and Zipper.

415
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:01,666
No, don't bother them.
We're as much real detectives

416
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:05,125
- as the Scooby-Doo gang.
- Exactly. That's why we have to try.

417
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:06,500
No! What?

418
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:08,625
Chip, Monty called
both of us looking for help

419
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:10,666
and we let him down.
We can't just let him rot

420
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:13,541
in some overseas studio,
being forced to make bad movies.

421
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:17,375
If he's gonna make bad movies,
he should be making them here with me.

422
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:19,791
Okay, even if we were
going to help,

423
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:23,333
we have no idea where to start.
We don't even know what we're...

424
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:25,791
Cheese.

425
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:29,791
Uh. Okay. Hey, listen.

426
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:31,583
Buddy, If you're low
on cash or something,

427
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:34,208
- I can buy you a nice, clean sandwich.
- Okay. Aha!

428
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:36,875
Here it is! I threw this out
when I came over earlier.

429
00:24:36,958 --> 00:24:40,083
"Bjornson's Cheese Shop.
3344, Main Street."

430
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:44,333
Um. Did you just find a clue?
You literally just sniffed out a clue!

431
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:46,767
Look, we can go to the cheese shop.
See what we can find out

432
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:48,625
about this secret facility
and Sweet Pete,

433
00:24:48,708 --> 00:24:51,666
then pass it along to the officer lady,
but that's all we're gonna do.

434
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:54,000
So, you're saying
the Rescue Rangers are back?

435
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:58,083
No, because there's no such thing
as Rescue Rangers. Case closed.

436
00:24:58,166 --> 00:25:00,125
- "{Case?"
- No, this is not a case

437
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:04,916
- because we're not real detectives.
- Oh ho ho! But you did say case. Yes!

438
00:25:18,958 --> 00:25:22,250
- Can I help you?
- Sorry.

439
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:25,916
I'm just happy to see you.
Chip 'n Dale, together again.

440
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:27,458
Yeah. Okay.

441
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:30,625
Ch... Ch... Ch... Chip 'n Dale!
Rescue Rangers

442
00:25:30,791 --> 00:25:33,072
- Ch... Ch... Ch... Chip 'n Dale!
- Stop singing the song.

443
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:36,916
You know they make
chipmunk-sized cars, right?

444
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,875
Duh. But human stuff is the best.

445
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:41,916
A little work done on her,
and she'll be back to her glory days.

446
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:44,625
Hey, watch out!

447
00:25:45,291 --> 00:25:47,583
Do you know what a metaphor is, Dale?

448
00:25:47,791 --> 00:25:49,434
If you're about to say
this car is a metaphor

449
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:50,938
for something about me, you can stop.

450
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:53,625
Because, no,
I don't know what a metaphor is.

451
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:55,500
Look, if we're gonna solve...

452
00:25:55,583 --> 00:25:57,517
"The Case of the Missing Monty."

453
00:25:57,541 --> 00:25:59,708
That's just a placeholder name.
Open to any ideas.

454
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:03,583
- We're gonna have to work together.
- We are not working together.

455
00:26:03,666 --> 00:26:05,375
You're funny, Chip.

456
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:09,708
Ugh...

457
00:26:10,708 --> 00:26:13,375
Okay, we're getting close.
Pull up over there.

458
00:26:17,916 --> 00:26:20,583
And leave the toup hat
and cane in the car, please.

459
00:26:20,791 --> 00:26:23,250
Whoa! How did you know that?

460
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,000
- 'Cause you're you.
- All right. Heads-up.

461
00:26:26,291 --> 00:26:30,166
Well... there's no faster way
to gain someone's respect

462
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,208
than to dress like
an important business magnet.

463
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:34,708
You mean business "magnate"?

464
00:26:34,833 --> 00:26:38,958
Uh. I think I know my own character, Chip,
and he wears a top hat.

465
00:26:43,583 --> 00:26:47,875
Ah, this place is pretty shady.
Are we sure it's safe?

466
00:26:47,958 --> 00:26:51,083
No. Because nothing's safe...

467
00:26:54,416 --> 00:26:56,333
...on Main Street.

468
00:27:00,458 --> 00:27:04,458
Oh, wow. It seems kinda nice.
It's not what I pictured.

469
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:08,083
Trust me, it's worse.
It's a bunch of cartoons trading

470
00:27:08,166 --> 00:27:10,750
on their wholesome public image
to keep the cops away.

471
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:13,125
And bring you
the slimiest backwater bazaar

472
00:27:13,208 --> 00:27:15,958
of contraband this side of Guadalajara.

473
00:27:16,166 --> 00:27:18,541
You sure about that?
That dog's blowing bubbles.

474
00:27:19,041 --> 00:27:20,333
Hello!

475
00:27:20,541 --> 00:27:24,208
Nothing, and I mean nothing
is sacred in this part of town.

476
00:27:24,583 --> 00:27:26,208
Bread for sale, bread for sale

477
00:27:26,291 --> 00:27:29,091
-Everyone loves bread for sale
-That guy, he sells untraceable weapons.

478
00:27:29,208 --> 00:27:31,833
Scoot, scoot
A shiny shoe makes the man

479
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:34,208
A shiny shoe, now there's a plan

480
00:27:34,416 --> 00:27:36,583
Stolen social security numbers.

481
00:27:36,708 --> 00:27:38,250
Roses are a way

482
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:40,583
- To make a girl feel pretty...
- No, thanks, kid.

483
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:44,041
- Muppet fights.
- Okay, why do you know all this?

484
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:47,375
Well, sometimes when I'm low on cash,
I sell my fur to that wig shop.

485
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,166
Hey. Far out.

486
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:51,750
-It's a stinky, it's a gooey
-CHIP: Ah, here.

487
00:27:51,833 --> 00:27:53,684
- It's a stinky, it's a gooey...
- I think this is our guy.

488
00:27:53,708 --> 00:27:56,166
I make deals for a living.
So, just let me do the talking.

489
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:59,125
- Ten-four. Got your back.
- No, you don't have my back. I got this.

490
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,875
Hi, Mr. Bjornson.
Do you have any cheese for sale?

491
00:28:03,166 --> 00:28:05,125
Oh, do I have cheese?

492
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:09,000
Let's see, we've got the Muenster,
the GGouda, the Brie.

493
00:28:09,208 --> 00:28:11,083
Do you have any "stinky cheese?"

494
00:28:113,333 --> 00:28:14,684
Are you cops?

495
00:28:14,708 --> 00:28:18,583
No! No. We just wanna buyy
some stinky cheese.

496
00:28:18,666 --> 00:28:20,458
The stinkier, the better.

497
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:26,958
All right, come on. Get in.

498
00:28:34,541 _-> 00:28:36,041
Oh, yeah.

499
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:40,000
- Oh, so good.
- More, please. More, please.

500
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:42,791
Choo! Choo!

501
00:28:42,875 --> 00:28:47,208
Hey, no more free samples, Lester.
This isn't Baskin Robbins.

502
00:28:47,666 --> 00:28:49,416
So, you want stinky cheese?

503
00:28:49,541 --> 00:28:52,458
I got smell lines that'll take you
through the ceiling.

504
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:55,625
Ow.

505
00:28:55,958 --> 00:28:59,833
"Through the ceiling," huh?
Seems like you offer a quality product.

506
00:28:59,916 --> 00:29:03,833
But hey, before we get into all that,
do me a favor. Take a look at this photo.

507
00:29:03,916 --> 00:29:06,416
It's a friend of mine named Monterey Jack.

508
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:08,500
Which is also the name of a cheese.

509
00:29:10,041 --> 00:29:12,000
- Continue.
- Right.

510
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:14,655
So, we think he's being held
in a warehouse somewhere.

511
00:29:14,708 --> 00:29:15,750
If you know anything,

512
00:29:15,833 --> 00:29:18,250
I'm sure we could make it
worth your while.

513
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:23,041
Like, what would you say to some
complementary RV or boat insurance?

514
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:29,083
Nah, I don't know nothin'.
Now, either buy some cheese or get out.

515
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:30,875
Oh, okay. Um...

516
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:35,208
Well, perhaps we should,
with the disrespectful tone

517
00:29:35,291 --> 00:29:37,875
this felted clodhopper takes,
why, I never!

518
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:41,250
- What are you doing?
- I am an important business magnet.

519
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:44,041
I shall have no trouble
attracting other suitors

5200
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:47,583
for my gigantic deal
because that's what magnets do.

521
00:29:47,791 --> 00:29:50,583
They attract business.

522
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:54,083
No, you two are definitely cops.
You're out of here.

523
00:29:54,166 --> 00:29:56,500
Okay, hold on.
This is getting out of hand.

524
00:29:56,583 --> 00:30:00,583
- We are not cops.
- We're actors!

525
00:30:01,208 --> 00:30:04,083
It's been us, Chip 'n Dale,
the whole time.

526
00:30:04,625 --> 00:30:09,958
Huh. Interesting. My boss,
Sweet Pete, he loves actors.

527
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:14,166
- Ah, yeah. Who doesn't?
- You know, I think you should meet him.

528
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:16,875
Really? Meeting Sweet Peten, huh?

529
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:21,000
Looks like I just took us
from outside the club to the VIP room.

530
00:30:24,416 --> 00:30:28,751
Wow! This VIP room is incredible!
I'm freaking out, dude.

531
00:30:28,833 --> 00:30:32,791
Is that Jessica Rabbit over there?
I'm only asking because I'm zip tied

532
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:35,625
- Cin the back of a truck!
- Whoa! What's with the attitude?

533
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,434
We were about to get
kicked out with your plan,

534
00:30:37,458 --> 00:30:40,166
and now, thanks to my sweet improv,
we're going to see Sweet Pete.

535
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:41,333
Oh, you're insane.

536
00:30:41,416 --> 00:30:42,500
- Am I?
- Of course.

537
00:30:42,583 --> 00:30:43,809
- So, you'd rather just give up?
- No!

538
00:30:43,833 --> 00:30:46,753
- You wanna just wait around...
- You should've just let me take the lead!

539
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,458
Hey! Hold on a second!

540
00:30:51,541 -_> 00:30:54,541
How adorable are we?
Chemistry like this doesn't just happen.

541
00:30:54,625 --> 00:30:56,583
This has got reboot written all over it.

542
00:30:56,666 --> 00:30:59,958
Ugh. Are you serious?
I should be home right now.

543
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:03,125
Millie is probably worried sick
and peeing all over the place.

544
00:31:03,208 --> 00:31:06,583
Oh, are you seeingg someone?
She sounds... nice.

545
00:31:06,666 --> 00:31:10,620
- She's a dog. Millie is a dog.
- Ah, I'm sure she's not that bad.

546
00:31:10,708 --> 00:31:13,500
What? No, she's...

547
00:31:20,416 --> 00:31:21,416
We're here.

548
00:31:25,375 --> 00:31:28,416
Whoa. This place looks weird.

549
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:30,125
Where are we?

550
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:35,791
Okay.

551
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,750
I think we're in the Valley.

552
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,500
- The Uncanny Valley.
- The what?

553
00:31:40,875 --> 00:31:44,833
Do you remember that weird
animation style in the early 2000s

554
00:31:44,916 --> 00:31:48,041
where everything looked real,
but nothing looked right?

555
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:50,166
Oh, yeah. That stuff was creepy.

556
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:52,333
Well, I think this is where they ended up.

557
00:31:52,416 --> 00:31:55,625
Come on. This way.

558
00:32:00,708 --> 00:32:03,166
- What?
- I got something for Sweet Pete.

559
00:32:03,291 --> 00:32:06,541
- A little gift from Bjornson.
- Okay, leave it there.

560
00:32:07,208 --> 00:32:09,000
Good luck, dummies.

561
00:32:09,416 --> 00:32:12,041
Blend, Cheese, Curd, Blend...

562
00:32:18,375 --> 00:32:22,708
- Who are you?
- Is he talking to us?

563
00:32:22,833 --> 00:32:26,750
I can't tell.
He's got those Polar Express eyes.

564
00:32:26,916 --> 00:32:32,500
- Uh. Are you talking to us?
- Obviously, I said, "Who are you?"

565
00:32:32,666 --> 00:32:35,083
Well, right. But in fairness,
it looks like you're talking

566
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:37,625
- to that window.
- No, it actually looks like

567
00:32:37,708 --> 00:32:39,833
- I'm looking right at you.
- Okay.

568
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:42,375
Look at my eyes,
looking right at your eyes.

569
00:32:42,666 --> 00:32:45,708
- Yeah.
- Okay. Listen, sir.

570
00:32:45,875 --> 00:32:48,375
Actually, you know what?
Get... Here, just...

571
00:32:48,458 --> 00:32:52,000
Get off me! Get your foot out of my mouth.

572
00:32:52,083 --> 00:32:56,041
Hey, there! Can you see me?
Hi! We just wanna talk to Sweet Pete.

573
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:58,958
Okay, follow me!

574
00:33:10,291 --> 00:33:12,416
I wonder if they're keeping Monty in here.

575
00:33:12,708 --> 00:33:14,458
There's only one way to find out.

576
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,750
So, is this your secret
bootlegging facility or what?

577
00:33:17,833 --> 00:33:20,750
- Come on!
- What? No! What are you talking about?

578
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:22,875
This is Sweet Pete's legit business.

579
00:33:22,958 --> 00:33:25,041
It's for old merchandise
that never got sold.

580
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:28,166
- Old merchandise?
- Yeah, like for example,

581
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:30,500
- you remember Shrek body wash?
- Uh...

582
00:33:30,583 --> 00:33:32,666
Exactly. No one does. It didn't sell.

583
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:35,458
That's why Sweet Pete
bought all the inventory,

584
00:33:35,583 --> 00:33:39,833
and melts it down for its useful parts.
The guy has a real eye for business.

585
00:33:39,958 --> 00:33:41,791
I wish I could see what he sees.

586
00:33:41,875 --> 00:33:45,583
I'm sure there's corrective lenses
or something you could get. Ow. What?

587
00:33:53,791 --> 00:33:58,500
So, he turns the toys into toy-lets.

588
00:33:58,625 --> 00:34:04,458
Wow! That's been staring at me for years,
and I never pieced it together.

589
00:34:05,583 --> 00:34:07,125
Here we are!

590
00:34:15,375 --> 00:34:16,375
Hello!

591
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,333
- Peter Pan?
- Yup!

592
00:34:18,625 --> 00:34:22,083
Star of stage and screen,
but you can call me Sweet Pete.

593
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:26,166
- Oh, you look...
- Old? Bald? Sad like a zoo gorilla?

594
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:30,583
- What? No. Not like a zoo gorilla.
- Don't worry.

595
00:34:30,666 --> 00:34:33,625
You can't say nothing to me
I haven't heard already. Jimmy, please.

596
00:34:33,708 --> 00:34:34,958
Untie our guests.

597
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:40,666
Chip and Dale! Wow!
You mind if I walk while we talk?

598
00:34:40,833 --> 00:34:44,458
Not fitting into the old costume
like I used to. Need to get my steps in.

599
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:46,375
Hey! I've got one of those.

600
00:34:46,458 --> 00:34:48,666
We should link accounts
and help motivate each other.

601
00:34:48,875 --> 00:34:53,375
Right. So, I'm guessing you two are here
to talk about Monterey Jack.

602
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:57,583
- Oh. Yeah, actually we are.
- You know, I always liked Monty.

603
00:34:57,708 --> 00:35:01,625
It's a shame what happened.
Too much cheese. Not enough bread.

604
00:35:01,916 --> 00:35:04,000
Listen, Mr. Sweet Pete... Mr. Pete.

605
00:35:04,083 --> 00:35:06,625
We'd be willing to pay
whatever Monty owes you

606
00:35:06,708 --> 00:35:09,208
if you could give him a break?
Just this once?

607
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:13,041
Hmm. "Give him a break"?
You know, I got my big break

608
00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:17,333
when I was just a kid. I got cast
in the biggest movie in the world,

609
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:20,500
as the boy who wouldn't grow up,
Peter Pan.

610
00:35:20,666 --> 00:35:23,541
I'd never been so happy in my entire life.

611
00:35:23,625 --> 00:35:28,000
Then I got older,
and they threw me away like I was nothing.

612
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:30,125
This business can be so tough

613
00:35:30,416 --> 00:35:31,750
You said it.

614
00:35:31,958 --> 00:35:35,500
I was scared, desperate, and all alone.

615
00:35:36,708 --> 00:35:41,875
So, I decided to take the power back
and make my own bootleg movie!

616
00:35:41,958 --> 00:35:44,916
I called it "Flying Bedroom Boy."

617
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,083
And guess what? It worked!
I made lots of money.

618
00:35:48,166 --> 00:35:52,125
So, I recruited other toons,
to star in more movies

619
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:56,208
and bang-a-rang, now I run
my own bootleg movie studio,

620
00:35:56,333 --> 00:36:00,916
where I get to decide who's a star,
and who gets thrown in the trash!

621
00:36:01,083 --> 00:36:04,583
And now, you two come
poking around where you don't belong,

622
00:36:04,791 --> 00:36:07,041
asking questions
about your missing friend.

623
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:10,583
And I can't have that.
So, how's this for a break?

624
00:36:10,708 --> 00:36:14,208
I'm thinking it's time
for a Chip 'n Dale reboot.

625
00:36:14,291 --> 00:36:16,833
- Jimmy...
- You, come with me.

626
00:36:16,958 --> 00:36:18,166
- Yup, we're dead.
- Run!

627
00:36:19,666 --> 00:36:21,500
Go, go, go, go, go!

628
00:36:21,583 --> 00:36:25,625
- Just grab them already!
- I'm trying!

629
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,750
Come on! Ready? Jump!

630
00:36:32,208 --> 00:36:33,583
Ah!

631
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:35,426
Hey!
That's my personal bathroom.

632
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,708
Look for a way out of here!

633
00:36:36,791 --> 00:36:38,250
- Hey!
- Uh... No.

634
00:36:38,333 --> 00:36:39,541
- Come out here!
- No.

635
00:36:39,625 --> 00:36:43,458
- Aha! There's only one way, Chip.
- No! That's disgusting.

636
00:36:43,541 --> 00:36:44,833
Jimmy, I got them!

637
00:36:44,916 --> 00:36:46,958
It's our only chance. Live a little!

638
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:49,958
Live a little?
You seem excited about this!

639
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:54,375
- Don't... No... Aw...
- Come on, Chip, the water's fine!

640
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:57,416
- Aw. Dang it!
- Come on! No!

641
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,541
O... okay.

642
00:36:58,625 --> 00:37:00,017
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you

643
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:01,666
Happy birth...

644
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:05,166
No, no! I'm done.

645
00:37:05,416 --> 00:37:07,833
You better pray
they don't make it out of there alive.

646
00:37:16,375 --> 00:37:19,250
- Whoa! No! No!
- Whoa! Hold on!

647
00:37:20,291 --> 00:37:21,416
Watch out!

648
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,300
- Hate this! Hate this!
- Oh, God!

649
00:37:26,208 --> 00:37:28,958
- I should probably get this!
- What?

650
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:33,541
- It could be my agent, Dave BoElinari!
- Oh, cool! Let me know what he says!

651
00:37:33,791 --> 00:37:36,875
Hello! What? Oh, yeah, spaghetti's fine!

652
00:37:36,958 --> 00:37:40,755
Love you too, Mom!
My agent is so weird.

653
00:37:42,958 --> 00:37:44,875
Try to grab something!

654
00:37:46,291 --> 00:37:48,791
- Pull, pull, pull, pull, pull!
- No! No!

655
00:37:55,958 --> 00:37:57,916
There! The paddle ball!

656
00:37:58,916 --> 00:38:01,625
Ready? Jump!

657
00:38:01,708 --> 00:38:04,208
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

658
00:38:04,291 --> 00:38:05,791
Hold on!

659
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:09,916
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

660
00:38:28,208 -->_00:38:30,250
Dale? Hello?

661
00:38:31,541 --> 00:38:34,541
Dale?

662
00:38:34,708 --> 00:38:36,958
Oh, no. Dale?

663
00:38:37,541 --> 00:38:40,375
Come on, don't, uh,
don't prank me like this.

664
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:49,833
- I should've...
- What's up?

665
00:38:50,125 --> 00:38:51,291
Not now, Dale.

666
00:38:51,583 --> 00:38:56,916
Dale! You're alive! But how?

667
00:38:58,125 --> 00:39:00,250
The name's Munk. Dale Munk.

668
00:39:00,666 --> 00:39:03,750
Ugh. Double-0 Dale, of course.

669
00:39:03,958 --> 00:39:07,750
Chip, you were crying.
You really do love me!

670
00:39:07,916 --> 00:39:10,375
- What? No! I... You were crying!
- Aw!

671
00:39:10,458 --> 00:39:12,333
- Can we...
- Chippy, Chippy, I love you too!

672
00:39:12,458 --> 00:39:14,791
Don't make it about you.
I was traumatized!

673
00:39:14,916 --> 00:39:16,059
- Aw.
- Just leave it alone, okay?

674
00:39:16,083 --> 00:39:20,458
Okay, fine. Well, that whole day
was a big waste!

675
00:39:20,583 --> 00:39:22,583
We didn't learn anything
of value except for that

676
00:39:22,666 --> 00:39:24,916
Sweet Pete wears
the same step tracker that I do.

677
00:39:25,208 --> 00:39:28,791
Wait, those step trackers,
do they keep track of everywhere you go?

678
00:39:28,875 --> 00:39:31,875
Yeah, I know because I like
to map my runs in the shape of a butt.

679
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,642
I can't believe I'm saying this,

680
00:39:33,666 --> 00:39:35,291
but we need to go talk to Ellie.

681
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:36,833
And then, I'm going home!

682
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:39,666
Okay, but please just don't tell her
about the butt thing.

683
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:42,041
I can't promise that.

684
00:39:42,125 --> 00:39:43,885
Do you think she'll think
it's funny, though?

685
00:39:48,875 --> 00:39:49,875
Thanks!

686
00:39:51,125 --> 00:39:54,000
SSo, if we could get a hold
of Sweet Pete's step tracker,

687
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:57,250
we could cross reference where he's been,
with where we know he goes!

688
00:39:57,333 --> 00:40:01,958
Right! And whatever doesn't overlap
has got to be his secret facility!

689
00:40:01,041 --> 00:40:04,708
Exactly! We get the step tracker,
and we can trace it to find Monty.

690
00:40:04,791 --> 00:40:08,083
- Chip, you're a genius!
- So, what's the plan?

691
00:40:08,166 --> 00:40:10,226
How are you guys gonna get
Sweet Pete's step tracker?

692
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:12,875
"You guys"? Hold on.
We got you the info you needed.

693
00:40:12,958 --> 00:40:17,125
Now, it's up to you, the professional,
to actually, you know, get the bad guy,

694
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:19,875
- and save our friend Monty?
- It's not as simple as that.

695
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:23,875
We need warrants, we need probable cause,
and I don't know if you guys noticed,

696
00:40:23,958 --> 00:40:26,791
but the captain doesn't really
value my opinion too much.

697
00:40:26,875 --> 00:40:31,625
- What? He's crazy!
- No, I really screwed up.

698
00:40:32,708 --> 00:40:35,000
Last year, when Peppa Pig went missing,

699
00:40:35,083 --> 00:40:38,541
I fell for a bogus tip,
and made the whole squad

700
00:40:38,625 --> 00:40:40,541
raid Nickelodeon Junior Studios.

701
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:43,583
And the toons fought back.

702
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:46,625
Paw Patrol attacked Sergeant Henderson.

703
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:49,916
The doctors say he'll never have kids.

704
00:40:51,875 --> 00:40:55,833
Huh, thank you for sharing
that absolutely bonkers story.

705
00:40:55,916 --> 00:40:59,125
I think I have exactly
what we need! Don't move.

706
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:04,250
Ladies and gentlemen.
Behold! The crime lab!

707
00:41:22,375 --> 00:41:27,833
What? This is crazy.

708
00:41:28,208 --> 00:41:31,916
Pretty sweet, right? All the disguises
and gadgets we could ever need.

709
00:41:33,041 --> 00:41:37,291
Wait, is this like every episode
oof Rescue Rangers ever?

710
00:41:37,375 --> 00:41:40,166
- Yes, it is.
- You've got them all.

711
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,625
"Catteries Not Included."

712
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:44,416
"Throw Mummy from the Train,"
"Dirty Rotten Diapers."

713
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,500
Okay, so what's your favorite episode?

714
00:41:46,583 --> 00:41:49,041
Ooh, I... I can't pick one.
That's too hard!

715
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:52,166
Same. So good.

716
00:41:55,125 --> 00:41:57,500
I'm honestly surprised
you kept all this stuff.

717
00:41:57,833 --> 00:42:00,208
I didn't think you cared
about the show back then.

718
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:01,916
WWhat? Of course I did.

719
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,250
No. Yeah, of course.

720
00:42:05,291 --> 00:42:07,541
What's this huge map
with all the pins in it?

721
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:09,625
Oh, that? It's actually very cool.

722
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:12,416
Oh, no. Is this where
all the victims are buried?

723
00:42:12,541 --> 00:42:14,708
You're messing with me again!

724
00:42:14,791 --> 00:42:18,666
It actually shows Rescue Rangers' ratings
in every US market in 1991

725
00:42:18,750_--> 00:42:21,541
which, as you may recall,
was our most successful year.

726
00:42:21,708 --> 00:42:23,958
Hey, Ellie, didn't you say
you were from Albany?

727
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,166
Born and raised.

728
00:42:25,291 --> 00:42:28,750
Well, according to this map
Rescue Rangers never aired in Albany.

729
00:42:28,833 --> 00:42:32,875
Yeah! My grandma, she used to tape
all the episodes and send them to me.

730
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:35,583
- Hmm.
- Grandmas rule!

731
00:42:35,708 --> 00:42:37,548
Oh, come on, Chip!
Look at all this cool stuff!

732
00:42:37,625 --> 00:42:41,250
Like this is the limited edition
Rescue Rangers pog set!

733
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,059
You know, this turned
into a real collectible,

734
00:42:43,083 --> 00:42:44,851
because someone noticed
that one of the clouds

735
00:42:44,875 --> 00:42:47,875
behind Monterey Jack
looked exactly like... BOprah.

736
00:42:47,958 --> 00:42:49,875
Wow. So cool.

737
00:42:49,958 --> 00:42:53,794
I know, right?
Unfortunately, I only have 11 of the 12.

738
00:42:53,875 --> 00:42:56,041
I'm missing the main one
of all bof us together.

739
00:42:56,125 --> 00:42:58,083
Ah, it's just old junk.

740
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:01,833
Okay, guys. SweetY Pete goes
to the Russian bathhouse every Wednesday.

741
00:43:01,958 --> 00:43:03,750
So, how are we gonna
sneak you guys in there

742
00:43:03,833 --> 00:43:05,875
without being recognized
by all those goons?!

743
00:43:06,291 --> 00:43:09,958
- Wait. What if we did episode 45?
- Forty-five?

744
00:43:10,791 --> 00:43:13,541
- That's a good idea.
- No idea what you're referring to.

745
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:15,375
And do you have any original ideas?

746
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:17,791
Or are you just
constantly recycling old scripts?

747
00:43:17,916 --> 00:43:21,125
Oh, come on! Episode_45!
You dressed up like a rat to fool me.

748
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:23,750
You don't remember?
You said, "Rats what I'm talking about."

749
00:43:23,833 --> 00:43:25,083
It was hilarious!

750
00:43:25,291 --> 00:43:27,791
Oh... Nope, no clue.

751
00:43:27,916 --> 00:43:30,458
Ellie, if we do this,
we could really use your help.

752
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:34,041
Um. I don't know.
I shouldn't even be here.

753
00:43:34,125 --> 00:43:39,375
Please!
I need you, Ellie! Help find me!

754
00:43:40,291 --> 00:43:43,831
- Okay, but just this once.
- Oh, thanks, love!

755
00:43:43,916 --> 00:43:45,666
Throw another shrimp on the barbie!

756
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:48,333
- Stop.
- No, I know, that's why I stopped, yeah?

757
00:43:56,583 --> 00:44:00,166
Okay, guys, remember,
you're plumbers here to fix a leaky pipe.

758
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:02,000
Roger that. This thing working?

759
00:44:02,166 --> 00:44:04,166
It's working.
I'd say we have about an hour

760
00:44:04,291 --> 00:44:07,916
before anyone notices
this van is missing, so shake a tail.

761
00:44:08,125 --> 00:44:09,916
I can't believe we're doing this.

762
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,541
Please, just don't do
your bad New York accent.

763
00:44:12,625 --> 00:44:14,625
Chip, I hear you,
but it's an unreasonable ask.

764
00:44:14,791 --> 00:44:17,017
Yo! We're here to clean the pipes,

765
00:44:17,041 --> 00:44:19,083
or did you forget about it?

766
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:26,291
Go Yanks! And hot dogs,
bagels, and pizza!

767
00:44:30,208 --> 00:44:32,875
Wow. I am honestly amazed
that that worked.

768
00:44:32,958 --> 00:44:35,875
Me too! That accent actually got me fired
from Law and Order.

769
00:44:35,958 --> 00:44:39,083
- Ellie, we're in.
- Good. Now, keep a low profile,

770
00:44:39,166 --> 00:44:40,791
and go find Sweet Pete's locker.

771
00:44:43,458 --> 00:44:44,541
Hey, you two!

772
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:47,208
This water fountain good?

773
00:44:47,291 --> 00:44:48,958
- Uh...
- Uh...

774
00:44:49,208 --> 00:44:50,875
Are the pipes clean to drink from?

775
00:44:50,958 --> 00:44:55,250
- Oh, um...
- Hey! They're cleaner than Broadway, baby.

776
00:44:55,333 --> 00:44:58,541
- I'm walking here.
- Good. Thank you.

777
00:45:04,541 --> 00:45:05,750
Hmm?

778
00:45:05,833 --> 00:45:09,250
Nice work. You need to stay up
on those pipes, out of sight.

779
00:45:09,333 --> 00:45:10,333
Yup! On it.

780
00:45:11,416 --> 00:45:13,916
Oh, yeah! That feels great, man.

781
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,291
- Gross!
- Nope. Come on.

782
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:19,708
I get the kids on the weekends,
but it's not the same.

783
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:29,208
Whoa. It's him.

784
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,083
There it is.

785
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,083
Okay, not great.

786
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:54,125
Hey, I know you.

787
00:45:54,208 --> 00:45:55,583
- Oh, no.
- We're cooked.

788
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:59,375
You're the Rescue Rangers.

789
00:46:01,416 --> 00:46:05,750
- I am huge fan boy!
- Oh, cool.

790
00:46:10,833 --> 00:46:13,416
Don't you just
hate awkward silences?

791
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:16,666
Well, to be honest, it wasn't awkward
until you said that, Jimmy,

792
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:18,833
and now it is, so great job.

793
00:46:18,916 --> 00:46:21,833
- I guess that's true.
- Guys, come on!

794
00:46:22,875 --> 00:46:24,767
-Step right up and come on in
-You are recognizing?

795
00:46:24,791 --> 00:46:26,631
-Here's where the fun begins
-Yes? Wait for it.

796
00:46:26,875 --> 00:46:30,458
No way! Is this a remix
of the Disney Afternoon theme song?

797
00:46:30,541 --> 00:46:32,625
- You made this?
- You are knowing it, brother!

798
00:46:32,708 --> 00:46:34,250
Now you do a rap on it? Yes?

799
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:37,291
Uh-oh, I don't know!
Give me one second with Dale here, bro.

800
00:46:37,375 --> 00:46:39,335
- First off, stop encouraging this guy.
- Totally.

801
00:46:39,416 --> 00:46:41,291
- Second, we are not rapping.
- Right.

802
00:46:41,375 --> 00:46:43,875
There is nothing more pathetic
than an old cartoon character

803
00:46:43,958 --> 00:46:46,375
- trying to seem cool again by rapping!
- Chip, I hear you,

804
00:46:46,458 --> 00:46:47,767
but I don't think
we have much of a choice!

805
00:46:47,791 --> 00:46:49,708
Oh, there's a choice.
When it comes to rapping,

806
00:46:49,791 --> 00:46:51,000
there's always a choice.

807
00:46:51,083 --> 00:46:52,684
Actually, can you just hold
that thought for one second?

808
00:46:52,708 --> 00:46:53,750
- Here I go!
- Oh, geez!

809
00:46:53,833 --> 00:46:55,666
My name is Dale...

810
00:46:55,958 --> 00:46:57,416
Uh...

811
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:58,500
I'm about to kick it

812
00:46:58,666 --> 00:47:00,541
- Oh, no.
- And I'm in hell.

813
00:47:00,625 --> 00:47:02,666
Oh, wow, hold on. I need to film this!

814
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:04,541
I'll distract him.
You get that step tracker.

815
00:47:04,625 --> 00:47:06,916
- It won't work. It's too risky.
- Well, the biggest risk

816
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,750
is not taking any risk at all. Uh!

817
00:47:09,833 --> 00:47:14,208
My name is Dale, I don't eat whale
Why would you say, that I eat whale

818
00:47:14,291 --> 00:47:15,500
I don't eat whale

819
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:18,625
Once you rhyme Dale with whale,
you can't think of anything else.

820
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:22,250
- Just devour him! Make it stop!
- Not me, no, I would just eat the tail

821
00:47:22,333 --> 00:47:23,458
Hmm.

822
00:47:29,333 --> 00:47:32,125
I would never in a million years
Eat whale

823
00:47:32,208 --> 00:47:34,166
First of all, they're endangered

824
00:47:35,375 --> 00:47:38,101
-So, you gotta take care of the whale
-Macadamias. And where there's nuts,

825
00:47:38,125 --> 00:47:40,583
- there's oil.
- Don't want PETA on your tail

826
00:47:40,666 --> 00:47:42,583
But if I did eat whale
It wouldn't be stale

827
00:47:42,708 --> 00:47:44,833
- Aha.
- Oh, man, I'm killing this!

828
00:47:44,958 --> 00:47:49,333
- And what are you doing?
- Oh, I was a just, uh...

829
00:47:49,416 --> 00:47:51,208
Aye, yo, Chip! Take the mic!

830
00:47:54,666 --> 00:47:56,416
Uh...

831
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:58,625
For Monty.

832
00:47:58,791 --> 00:48:02,041
Well, my name is Chip, I'm not a whale

833
00:48:02,125 --> 00:48:04,041
And now I'm doing it, great.

834
00:48:04,416 --> 00:48:07,083
A zubi-zong, zubi, zubi, zubi, dong, dong

835
00:48:07,208 --> 00:48:08,916
- Yo ink.
- Zubi, dong, dong, dong

836
00:48:09,291 --> 00:48:11,000
-'Cause he's Chip
-He's Dale

837
00:48:11,083 --> 00:48:12,083
And we'll never fail!

838
00:48:12,166 --> 00:48:14,250
'Cause neither of us
Will ever eat whale

839
00:48:14,375 --> 00:48:15,375
-No, never
-Ever

840
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:16,500
-Never
-Ever

841
00:48:16,583 --> 00:48:17,666
-Never eat whale
-Eat whale

842
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:19,684
Okay, what? How did you know
what I was gonna say?

843
00:48:19,708 --> 00:48:21,708
How did you know
what I was gonna say? It was like,

844
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:22,809
- professional.
- Professional.

845
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:24,309
- Same time!
- Same time!

846
00:48:24,333 --> 00:48:25,533
- Jinx!
- Jinx!

847
00:48:25,583 --> 00:48:27,601
- You owe me a non-brand specific cola!
- You owe me a non-brand specific cola!

848
00:48:27,625 --> 00:48:29,309
- What? That was crazy!
- What? That was crazy!

849
00:48:29,333 --> 00:48:31,684
- Somebody call Guinness book!
- Somebody call Guinness book!

850
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:34,375
- This is incredible!
- This is blowing my mind!

851
00:48:34,458 --> 00:48:35,541
We lost it.

852
00:48:35,708 --> 00:48:40,833
Boom, boom. It's DJ Herzogenaurach
with the Disney Afternoon remix!

853
00:48:40,916 --> 00:48:44,625
Hey, this was really fun,
but we actually got to get going!

854
00:48:44,833 --> 00:48:47,416
Ooh, they were very bad at rapping.

855
00:48:48,041 --> 00:48:51,166
Oh, hey, Bob! You are never going
to believe who I just met.

856
00:48:53,666 --> 00:48:55,458
Oh, man, Ellie, you should have seen us!

857
00:48:55,625 --> 00:48:57,065
- That was incredible!
- Right?

858
00:48:57,166 --> 00:48:58,526
We were just like real detectives!

859
00:48:58,625 --> 00:49:01,208
And that match trick
you did with the oil? Genius!

860
00:49:01,291 --> 00:49:04,750
Yeah, but your bad rapping
was the perfect distraction. So good!

861
00:49:04,833 --> 00:49:08,208
Thanks. I totally thought we were busted.
But then you just fully went for it!

862
00:49:08,291 --> 00:49:11,666
- And then I rapped. What a rush!
- You were crazy!

863
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:14,750
Okay, we are all set here.
Just plug that step tracker

864
00:49:14,833 --> 00:49:16,500
- into the computer.
- On it!

865
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,708
Oh, San Pedro docks! Yes, we got him!

866
00:49:23,791 --> 00:49:26,500
I can't believe it.
We might actually get Monty back.

867
00:49:26,625 --> 00:49:30,541
- We're gonna be heroes.
- I gotta thank you for making me do this.

868
00:49:30,625 --> 00:49:36,416
- I mean, this feels... I feel... good.
- Me too! We were always better together.

869
00:49:36,958 --> 00:49:39,625
Location confirmed.
We're sending SWAT now by chopper.

870
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:41,333
- Meet us there.
- Yes, sir.

871
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Here, Captain.

872
00:49:56,083 --> 00:49:58,458
I ought to suspend you
for going behind my bback, Steckler.

873
00:49:58,541 --> 00:50:01,166
And I hope we don't get attacked
by the Rugrats this time.

874
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:03,958
Ready the battering rams!

875
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:07,041
Let's go! Move! Move! Move!

876
00:50:17,208 --> 00:50:19,291
- Clear!
- Clear!

877
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:22,291
Clear!

878
00:50:23,083 --> 00:50:26,125
- Where do you think he is?
- I have no idea.

879
00:50:34,541 --> 00:50:35,541
Sir!

880
00:50:36,958 --> 00:50:38,500
I think I found something.

881
00:50:43,416 --> 00:50:46,083
Careful. Don't touch anything.

882
00:50:59,041 --> 00:51:00,041
Fflounder?

883
00:51:82,166 --> 00:51:03,166
Sneezy?

884
00:51:04,833 --> 00:51:06,125
They're all here.

885
00:51:06,708 --> 00:51:10,791
Whoa. Garfield's little body
can't take muscles like that.

886
00:51:11,458 --> 00:51:12,625
We found 'em.

887
00:51:15,125 --> 00:51:18,041
This looks like the machine
I had my CG work done on.

888
00:51:19,041 --> 00:51:22,125
Except, way more violent-looking.

889
00:51:23,875 --> 00:51:27,666
It's still warm.
Must have just missed him.

890
00:51:28,208 --> 00:51:30,291
Yeah, this place is creepy.

891
00:51:30,375 --> 00:51:32,541
I'm gonna see
if I can't find a light switch.

892
00:51:32,625 --> 00:51:35,375
Wait. No, no, no, no,
don't, don't, don't, don't, don't!

893
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:42,166
- See? Nothing to worry about!
- Heh. I guess you're right.

894
00:51:43,958 --> 00:51:45,958
Uh. That's not good.

895
00:51:46,041 --> 00:51:48,458
- Dude! What did you do?
- I didn't mean to,

896
00:51:48,583 --> 00:51:50,958
I just... I put my leg back, my toe...

897
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:52,916
- Chip!
- Why is it on the floor?

898
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,041
Dale!

899
00:51:54,833 --> 00:51:56,976
- Ah, no! Watch out!
- Get out of there!

900
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,833
No, no, no, no, no!

901
00:52:04,416 --> 00:52:06,250
Help! Get us out of here!

902
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:10,916
The machine is gonna try
and surgically re-edit you,

903
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,666
so, try to avoid that.

904
00:52:12,958 --> 00:52:15,583
Goodbye, Ellie! Always remember me!

905
00:52:15,666 --> 00:52:18,291
If we don't make it out of here alive,
let Millie live with you,

906
00:52:18,375 --> 00:52:20,083
and sleep on your bed,
and eat your food,

907
00:52:20,166 --> 00:52:22,250
and don't be afraid
to really scratch that butt!

908
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:31,166
Are we about
to get waffle fried?

909
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:32,583
No, I think it's...

910
00:52:32,666 --> 00:52:34,642
Scanning them,
and rendering what they'll look like

911
00:52:34,666 --> 00:52:36,375
in different animation styles.

912
00:52:42,333 --> 00:52:46,208
Okay. That was nothing.
You know, this might be easier than...

913
00:52:46,291 --> 00:52:47,500
Dale!

914
00:52:47,583 --> 00:52:50,458
- Hey! Hey!
- Hold on!

915
00:52:53,041 --> 00:52:56,041
- Pull harder!
- Why... won't... you... stretch?

916
00:52:56,125 --> 00:52:58,916
This body is meant
to be looked at, not touched!

917
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
What are you doing?

918
00:53:04,583 --> 00:53:06,250
Whoa!

919
00:53:06,333 --> 00:53:07,958
- Thank you.
- Come on!

920
00:53:10,458 --> 00:53:11,666
Whoa.

921
00:53:12,666 --> 00:53:15,875
- It's like episode 121!
- "Mission Chipossible!"

922
00:53:15,958 --> 00:53:17,833
- You're right.
- Wait, you remember?

923
00:53:17,916 --> 00:53:19,875
I guess a couple things
are coming back to me.

924
00:53:19,958 --> 00:53:21,916
Then let's do it.
How different could it be?

925
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,083
- Very different! It can be very different.
- Ready?

926
00:53:25,458 --> 00:53:27,041
Jump! Duck!

927
00:53:28,041 --> 00:53:30,416
Pancake. Launch me!

928
00:53:35,416 --> 00:53:38,625
- Heads-up!
- Got you!

929
00:53:38,708 --> 00:53:40,708
Slide!

930
00:53:43,875 --> 00:53:49,208
- You okay? Are you in one piece?
- Yeah, I think so. But you're not.

931
00:53:49,291 --> 00:53:50,291
Huh?

932
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:57,250
I'm sure they're fine.

933
00:53:57,333 --> 00:53:59,541
- You got a Snoopy ear!
- Get it off! Get it off!

934
00:54:02,083 --> 00:54:04,000
The door! Let's get out of here!

935
00:54:15,541 --> 00:54:19,166
What the...

936
00:54:26,291 --> 00:54:27,583
You guys okay?

937
00:54:33,333 --> 00:54:34,750
Look at all these parts.

938
00:54:36,333 --> 00:54:37,540
Oh, no.

939
00:54:38,916 --> 00:54:43,375
- Monty's mustache.
- No!

940
00:54:44,958 --> 00:54:46,791
He's been bootlegged!

941
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,166
Hey, Steckler.

942
00:55:01,916 --> 00:55:04,625
Nice work, today.
I didn't think you had it in you.

943
00:55:05,541 --> 00:55:06,583
Thank you, sir.

944
00:55:07,875 --> 00:55:09,392
Over here.
One question! Over here!

945
00:55:09,416 --> 00:55:12,291
3D In Your Face News.
With this factory shut down,

946
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:15,041
how does it feel
to have made the city safer for toons?

947
00:55:15,125 --> 00:55:17,208
All right, come on.
Leave them alone. No questions.

948
00:55:17,291 --> 00:55:19,166
Come on, guys, let's get out of here.

949
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:20,767
Hey, Chip, why the Snoopy ear?

950
00:55:20,791 --> 00:55:22,916
Captain Putty! Captain Putty!
Black and White News.

951
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,840
Why is there a wad
of chewing gum on your back?

952
00:55:24,916 --> 00:55:26,708
Oh, come on! Gross.

953
00:55:26,791 --> 00:55:29,208
Now, that's just gonna be
a part of me forever.

954
00:55:30,958 --> 00:55:32,666
Well, this is a mess.

955
00:55:32,875 --> 00:55:34,892
We should probably skip down
for a while, huh, boss?

956
00:55:34,916 --> 00:55:37,333
We're not going anywhere without
those chipmunks.

957
00:55:37,458 --> 00:55:40,458
- I still want my reboot.
- Should we try to follow them?

958
00:55:40,583 --> 00:55:45,791
Nah, let 'em go. I have
my own special way of tracking people.

959
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,458
- Are we sure that every room was checked?
- Yeah. Positive.

960
00:56:05,625 --> 00:56:09,375
You said bootlegging takes 48 hours.
We made it before then.

961
00:56:09,625 --> 00:56:13,916
- I know. It usually does.
- And that coffee was still warm.

962
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:15,791
It's like they knew we were coming.

963
00:56:15,875 --> 00:56:18,791
Look, I know you guys are sad
about Monty,

964
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:22,166
but you should still feel really good
about what you did back there.

965
00:56:22,375 --> 00:56:26,750
- You guys are heroes.
- We are not heroes. Monty's gone.

966
00:56:26,833 --> 00:56:29,250
I was so excited
to see his big, dopey face.

967
00:56:36,166 --> 00:56:39,583
I'm telling you,
we're missing something.

968
00:56:39,666 --> 00:56:41,000
I can feel it, Dale.

969
00:56:41,083 --> 00:56:44,916
Hey, just wanna remind you guys,
I'll be at Fan Con this afternoon,

970
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,208
signing autographs.
So, get those nuts ready!

971
00:56:49,041 --> 00:56:50,958
- Yeah...
- What is wrong with you?

972
00:56:51,041 --> 00:56:52,416
What? It's my job.

973
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:55,750
It's a choice.
I'm getting some coffee.

974
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,375
Wh... Come on! I have
to stay connected to the fans!

975
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:03,041
There are no fans.
It's for you. It's always for you,

976
00:57:03,208 --> 00:57:05,125
to feed your selfish ego.

977
00:57:05,708 --> 00:57:08,375
I thought you had changed,
but you haven't changed

978
00:57:08,458 --> 00:57:09,916
since Double-0 Dale!

979
00:57:10,375 --> 00:57:12,958
Wait, so you are still mad
about Double-0 Dale?

980
00:57:13,041 --> 00:57:14,500
I thought everything was artichokie.

981
00:57:14,666 --> 00:57:18,708
You left, Dale. You left me high and dry.
After everything we'd been through,

982
00:57:18,791 --> 00:57:20,458
everything I did for you!

983
00:57:21,041 --> 00:57:24,041
- So, we're not artichokie?
- No artichokie!

984
00:57:24,125 --> 00:57:28,625
Nothing's ever been artichokie.
Okay? I'm alone. I sell insurance.

985
00:57:28,708 --> 00:57:30,708
My only friend is a dog!

986
00:57:30,833 --> 00:57:33,291
Okay, but then
why did you say it was artichokie?

987
00:57:33,375 --> 00:57:34,976
I mean, when someone tells me
something's artichokie,

988
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,291
I believe it's artichokie.

989
00:57:36,416 --> 00:57:40,041
Stop saying artichokie!
What is it, man?

990
00:57:40,208 --> 00:57:45,000
Oh, uh, if you could just scooch a bit,
from the coffee?

991
00:57:45,291 --> 00:57:48,083
Yes, yes, of course. Sorry.

992
00:57:48,166 --> 00:57:51,916
See? This is why
I didn't wanna see you anymore.

993
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,333
Sure, my life is lonely,
but at least I didn't feel like this!

994
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:58,708
Oh, yeah? Well, you're the same too!
Chip's always in charge!

995
00:57:58,791 --> 00:58:01,166
Chip's always right!
It's Chip's way or the highway!

996
00:58:01,416 --> 00:58:04,666
You know what? Here.
I've been holding on to this

997
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:08,875
for some stupid reason.
Now, your collection is complete.

998
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,458
What?

999
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:15,791
You kept this?

1000
00:58:18,416 --> 00:58:21,625
You know the crazy thing is,
way back then...

1001
00:58:22,458 --> 00:58:24,166
I didn't even wanna do Double-0 Dale.

1002
00:58:24,875 --> 00:58:28,166
- What?
- It's gonna sound stupid, but...

1003
00:58:28,291 --> 00:58:31,333
...I think I just wanted you
to tell me you needed me.

1004
00:58:31,416 --> 00:58:35,000
That I wasn't just some pathetic chipmunk
you found eating alone at school.

1005
00:58:36,541 --> 00:58:40,250
You know, I wanted this pog
for some silly reason, but now I don't.

1006
00:58:40,333 --> 00:58:43,625
- Here, now your collection's complete.
- What? Don't give me that!

1007
00:58:43,708 --> 00:58:45,833
That's the exact same thing
I just said to you.

1008
00:58:45,958 --> 00:58:47,666
What? No, it's not.
I said, "silly reason."

1009
00:58:47,750 --> 00:58:49,958
- You said, "stupid reason."
- Well, I don't want it.

1010
00:58:50,041 --> 00:58:51,250
- Neither do I!
- Good!

1011
00:58:51,333 --> 00:58:52,726
- I'm putting it on the ground.
- Great!

1012
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:53,750
- Yeah.
- Cool.

1013
00:58:53,833 --> 00:58:54,875
- I know.
- Neat!

1014
00:58:54,958 --> 00:58:56,500
It is neat. Thanks.

1015
00:58:59,333 --> 00:59:01,875
Do you smell that?

1016
00:59:02,166 --> 00:59:05,250
I'm definitely not falling
for one of your dumb fart jokes right now.

1017
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,875
No! No, no! Smell!

1018
00:59:07,958 --> 00:59:09,708
This whole place, it smells like...

1019
00:59:10,458 --> 00:59:12,684
- almond butter and gasoline.
- Almond butter and gasoline.

1020
00:59:12,708 --> 00:59:14,750
But that's the Rescue Rangers cologne.

1021
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,458
This way.

1022
00:59:27,916 --> 00:59:30,333
It's coming from in here.

1023
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:37,291
Why would Putty's office
smell like that?

1024
00:59:37,833 --> 00:59:41,333
Ddale, we need to leave, now.

1025
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:43,583
What's going on? Why are we running away?

1026
00:59:43,666 --> 00:59:45,458
I'm not sure, but you
and your big red nose

1027
00:59:45,541 --> 00:59:48,333
are onto something.
Monty was literally the only person

1028
00:59:48,416 --> 00:59:51,336
- to ever use that disgusting cologne.
- Actually, I heard it's still used

1029
00:59:51,375 --> 00:59:53,017
in the Latvia to strip paint,
but of course,

1030
00:59:53,041 --> 00:59:54,791
we never see a dime of that.

1031
00:59:54,916 --> 00:59:57,293
That's not the point.
Putty's office stunk of it,

1032
00:59:57,375 --> 01:00:00,000
which means someone had
direct contact with Monty.

1033
01:00:00,083 --> 01:00:02,226
- Oh, I knew Putty was dirty!
- Oh, you're just saying that

1034
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:04,458
'cause it's always the police captain
in our episodes.

1035
01:00:04,541 --> 01:00:06,875
Putty's too obvious! Think, Dale!

1036
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,708
- Ellie?
- Something has been off about her

1037
01:00:08,791 --> 01:00:09,916
the whole time!

1038
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,208
Claiming to be a huge fan
just to butter us up.

1039
01:00:12,291 --> 01:00:14,125
She couldn't even name
her favorite episode.

1040
01:00:14,208 --> 01:00:17,208
- 'Cause she loves them all.
- No! 'Cause she's never seen any episodes!

1041
01:00:17,458 --> 01:00:19,916
"Her grandmother
taped the show for her." Get real!

1042
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,640
Grandparents are terrible at electronics.
That's their whole thing!

1043
01:00:22,708 --> 01:00:25,500
Aha! Speak of the devil!

1044
01:00:25,625 --> 01:00:28,500
Are you crazy? Don't pick that up!
We don't know who we can trust.

1045
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:31,875
We need outside help,
like the governor, the CIA, the FBI.

1046
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,041
I know someone
who might be able to help.

1047
01:00:36,166 --> 01:00:39,750
You got a Snoopy ear!

1048
01:00:39,833 --> 01:00:43,583
Yes, Ugly Sonic, his ear is hilarious,
but do you have a contact at the FBI?

1049
01:00:43,666 --> 01:00:46,586
Because we have some highly dangerous
and classified information for them.

1050
01:00:46,666 --> 01:00:49,041
Yeah, of course.
I know tons of people at the FBI.

1051
01:00:49,125 --> 01:00:52,125
- I'm making a TV show with them.
- Look, we really need your help,

1052
01:00:52,208 --> 01:00:53,708
but we don't have a lot of time.

1053
01:00:53,791 --> 01:00:57,458
Oh, you want me to go fast?
That's Sonic's thing.

1054
01:00:57,791 --> 01:01:04,708
Ugly Sonic goes slow, baby.

1055
01:01:05,333 --> 01:01:07,133
- So, you're not gonna help us?
- No, I'm not.

1056
01:01:07,166 --> 01:01:10,208
Ugh! You don't have a show with the FBI.
I knew it! I knew it!

1057
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:11,416
I wasn't finished.

1058
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:13,434
- Dale, we need to go.
- I'll run it by my producer later

1059
01:01:13,458 --> 01:01:15,142
- when I see him at the Chateau.
- Oh, no.

1060
01:01:15,166 --> 01:01:18,500
- Quick, we'll lose them in the crowd.
- One day, you'll see, Dale.

1061
01:01:18,666 --> 01:01:21,833
You'll turn on your television
and all will be revealed.

1062
01:01:21,916 --> 01:01:24,125
- No, it won't.
- Yes, it will!

1063
01:01:24,208 --> 01:01:26,250
Move!

1064
01:01:26,458 --> 01:01:29,750
Out of the way! Move it, nerds!

1065
01:01:29,875 --> 01:01:32,333
You know, originally,
it was called Aunt Man,

1066
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:36,708
A-U-N-T, and my superpower
was being really charming to aunts.

1067
01:01:36,791 --> 01:01:39,958
That's great, isn't it?

1068
01:01:40,041 --> 01:01:41,517
- Yeah, they changed it...
- Whoa! Coming through.

1069
01:01:41,541 --> 01:01:42,833
Love your work!

1070
01:01:42,916 --> 01:01:44,125
- Whoa!
- Watch out!

1071
01:01:44,208 --> 01:01:46,248
- Okay. Nice horsey, nice horsey.
- Whoa!

1072
01:01:46,416 --> 01:01:48,625
Step aside. Move.

1073
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:54,750
- There they are.
- Well, go get them.

1074
01:02:01,875 --> 01:02:04,791
- Gotcha!
- Oh, what?

1075
01:02:04,958 --> 01:02:10,958
- Peter, is that really you? You got old.
- Yeah, death is coming for us all, kid.

1076
01:02:12,333 --> 01:02:15,416
- How do they know we're here?
- I'm guessing your social media post

1077
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:16,791
at the police station.

1078
01:02:16,875 --> 01:02:18,791
Ah! Oops.

1079
01:02:18,916 --> 01:02:21,833
- Yeah, that's my bad.
- Hey, there's something down there.

1080
01:02:21,958 --> 01:02:23,916
There's nothing down there, you boob.

1081
01:02:24,166 --> 01:02:27,916
You walk around with no pants long enough,
and you start to notice every breeze.

1082
01:02:28,041 --> 01:02:29,708
Gotcha! Huh?

1083
01:02:30,875 --> 01:02:34,166
We need a disguise or something.
In here. Grab the first thing you can.

1084
01:02:35,541 --> 01:02:37,916
Uh... What?

1085
01:02:41,291 --> 01:02:42,708
It's the Rescue Rangers!

1086
01:02:42,791 --> 01:02:46,291
- Oh, my gosh! I am your biggest fan!
- Oh, my God.

1087
01:02:49,375 --> 01:02:52,375
Cook-a-rook-a-roo!

1088
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:55,458
Think happy little thoughts.

1089
01:02:55,541 --> 01:02:57,375
Definitely pulled something.

1090
01:02:57,458 --> 01:02:59,875
You keep going, I'll catch up.

1091
01:02:59,958 --> 01:03:01,166
Hey, give me that!

1092
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,166
Ugh! It's diet!

1093
01:03:03,791 --> 01:03:07,875
Up here. Hey!

1094
01:03:10,083 --> 01:03:14,041
By the axe of Ucarga,
you will submit to me!

1095
01:03:21,416 --> 01:03:24,708
What are you doing? I got you!

1096
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,625
What are you looking at?

1097
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:34,583
- Honestly, your weird dead eyes.
- They are weird.

1098
01:03:34,666 --> 01:03:35,791
Super weird.

1099
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:38,375
So funny.

1100
01:03:45,291 --> 01:03:47,958
Well, I'll be.
Chip and Dale together again

1101
01:03:48,041 --> 01:03:49,791
Never thought I'd see the day.

1102
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:51,500
Get back here!

1103
01:03:54,708 --> 01:03:55,708
Wow.

1104
01:03:55,916 --> 01:03:59,166
- Yo, man, it's you!
- Baloo. Nice to meet you.

1105
01:03:59,375 --> 01:04:03,666
No way! Can I touch your face?
I mean, what is going on?

1106
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:06,000
Quick, the elevator.

1107
01:04:07,041 --> 01:04:08,416
Oh, no!

1108
01:04:08,583 --> 01:04:12,083
I command thee to halt!

1109
01:04:12,291 --> 01:04:16,041
You want a piece of me? Be my guest.

1110
01:04:16,166 --> 01:04:17,708
Berserker!

1111
01:04:17,791 --> 01:04:19,375
Ah, ah, ah!

1112
01:04:19,666 --> 01:04:23,708
Hello, 911?
I have a rather unruly visitor here.

1113
01:04:23,791 --> 01:04:26,208
There's the exit.

1114
01:04:30,125 --> 01:04:32,791
Go, Dale. Go!

1115
01:04:32,875 --> 01:04:34,000
Come on, Chip!

1116
01:04:37,875 --> 01:04:40,541
Quick! Hide up here!

1117
01:04:53,375 --> 01:04:56,500
Chip?

1118
01:04:58,541 --> 01:05:01,083
Chip, where are you?

1119
01:05:01,208 --> 01:05:03,583
Where are you, buddy?

1120
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:09,958
No. No, no, no, no, no, no!

1121
01:05:11,375 --> 01:05:14,666
Hey, Steckler. I just got a tip.
I think your little chipmunk friends

1122
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:16,083
- are in trouble.
- I know, sir.

1123
01:05:16,166 --> 01:05:19,101
- I'm heading to the Convention Center now.
- No, it's worse than that. Come on.

1124
01:05:19,125 --> 01:05:20,875
We gotta move fast before it's too late.

1125
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:23,438
You're gonna arrest me
while Jack Skellington's been embezzling

1126
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:25,916
from his own charity for years?
Everyone knows it!

1127
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:30,583
Where's Dale?

1128
01:05:30,666 --> 01:05:32,875
He'll be here.
Keep your pants on.

1129
01:05:32,958 --> 01:05:35,250
- I don't wear pants.
- Yeah, I noticed.

1130
01:05:35,416 --> 01:05:37,375
It's not something to brag about.

1131
01:05:37,458 --> 01:05:38,500
What do you want?

1132
01:05:38,583 --> 01:05:41,208
I want you to stop messing
with my business.

1133
01:05:41,333 --> 01:05:44,125
You exposed everything,
now I have to move all this stuff,

1134
01:05:44,208 --> 01:05:46,208
and start over. It's super annoying.

1135
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:49,291
You should have just let me bootleg you
when you came to my office.

1136
01:05:49,375 --> 01:05:51,958
Could have saved us both
a ton of headaches.

1137
01:05:52,291 --> 01:05:53,291
Ah!

1138
01:05:53,541 --> 01:05:58,125
Besides, I was always more
of an Alvin and the Chipmunks person.

1139
01:05:58,375 --> 01:06:00,458
You monster.

1140
01:06:00,541 --> 01:06:02,541
Freeze, Sweet Pete.

1141
01:06:03,916 --> 01:06:06,166
Nah. How about you freeze?

1142
01:06:08,041 --> 01:06:09,375
Drop it, Steckler.

1143
01:06:10,125 --> 01:06:14,000
- What? Captain Putty?
- Dale was right.

1144
01:06:14,083 --> 01:06:18,000
- How cliché.
- I know. It is a bit unoriginal, right?

1145
01:06:18,083 --> 01:06:19,892
Sweet Pete, remember
when you first approached me

1146
01:06:19,916 --> 01:06:22,041
to turn bad, be a bad guy, work with you,

1147
01:06:22,125 --> 01:06:24,958
and I was like,
"Come on! That's too predictable."

1148
01:06:25,041 --> 01:06:26,625
Yeah. And what did I say?

1149
01:06:26,708 --> 01:06:28,628
- "If it ain't broke..."
- "If it ain't broke..."

1150
01:06:30,375 --> 01:06:32,875
- How could you?
- I know, I know. It's terrible.

1151
01:06:32,958 --> 01:06:37,791
I am so ashamed. But I had no choice.
My mother needed an operation.

1152
01:06:37,875 --> 01:06:41,416
See, she got injured
playing a game of Operation.

1153
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:44,125
She got too close to the sides
and, uh...

1154
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:48,250
...she got buzzed really bad.

1155
01:06:48,333 --> 01:06:52,791
Oh, I'm sorry.
I couldn't do it any longer.

1156
01:06:52,875 --> 01:06:54,875
Money! I'm a greedy little Smurf

1157
01:06:54,958 --> 01:06:57,625
- who did it for the money.
- Hilarious.

1158
01:06:57,708 --> 01:06:59,809
Yeah, but I had you going there
for a second, didn't I?

1159
01:06:59,833 --> 01:07:03,625
"Hello, I think I just saw Peppa Pig
heading into Nickelodeon Jr."

1160
01:07:03,708 --> 01:07:05,666
It was you?

1161
01:07:06,458 --> 01:07:08,416
You gave the fake tip.

1162
01:07:08,958 --> 01:07:11,625
You derailed the whole
investigation and...

1163
01:07:11,708 --> 01:07:14,041
and worst of all,
you made me doubt myself.

1164
01:07:14,125 --> 01:07:16,791
Oh, come on. Don't be so fragile.

1165
01:07:16,875 --> 01:07:20,666
Oh, wow, wow, oh, wow!
Keep it together, Dale. Come on.

1166
01:07:21,333 --> 01:07:22,934
It's Ellie.

1167
01:07:22,958 --> 01:07:27,000
Wait, no, Ellie could be bad.
But she also could be good.

1168
01:07:27,083 --> 01:07:31,458
Oh, my brain hurts. I wish Chip was here.
He'd know what to do.

1169
01:07:31,541 --> 01:07:32,791
Uh...

1170
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:36,166
- Hello?
- Hey. You okay?

1171
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:39,041
Uh, yeah, totally fine. Why do you ask?

1172
01:07:39,208 --> 01:07:42,083
You don't have to worry, Dale.
I know how to get Chip back.

1173
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:45,541
I'm down at the bootlegging facility.
Meet me here.

1174
01:07:46,458 --> 01:07:47,625
And come alone.

1175
01:07:47,708 --> 01:07:49,916
Well, that sounds super shady
and not safe at all.

1176
01:07:50,041 --> 01:07:52,125
I know. But you have to trust me.

1177
01:07:52,208 --> 01:07:55,916
And, Dale, "When You Fish Upon A Star,"
that's my favorite episode.

1178
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,291
Oh. Kind of a deep cut.
Why is that your favorite?

1179
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:01,708
Hello? Huh.

1180
01:08:01,791 --> 01:08:04,416
I mean, "When You Fish Upon A Star"
is a good episode,

1181
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:06,458
but I wouldn't call it great.

1182
01:08:06,625 --> 01:08:09,208
Why did you tell Dale to come?
You should have protected him.

1183
01:08:09,291 --> 01:08:11,916
I gave him a secret message. A code.

1184
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,083
Dale forgets his own phone number.
How is he gonna break a code?

1185
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:18,583
Listen up, you rejects
from a science lab.

1186
01:08:18,666 --> 01:08:20,947
I didn't think of this extraordinarily

1187
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,291
brilliant plan, only to have

1188
01:08:22,458 --> 01:08:24,851
- you idiots wreck the wrong ship.
- Still holds up. It's a great show.

1189
01:08:24,875 --> 01:08:27,559
- A ship full of worthless junk!
- Ah, no! Focus, Dale. Come on.

1190
01:08:27,583 --> 01:08:29,851
- Ellie is sending a message, but what?
- ...you know?

1191
01:08:29,875 --> 01:08:33,333
Your little friends would never dream
of leaving you hanging here.

1192
01:08:33,416 --> 01:08:36,458
- Would they?
- All right. Think, Dale, think.

1193
01:08:36,541 --> 01:08:41,500
Gadget is stuck in a lantern.
Lanterns provide light by using fire.

1194
01:08:41,583 --> 01:08:44,791
Fire is really cool,
but also really dangerous.

1195
01:08:45,041 --> 01:08:47,083
Someone is in a dangerous situation.

1196
01:08:47,166 --> 01:08:49,184
Oh, like that time I dropped
a bowling ball on my toe.

1197
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:52,791
Ellie has ten toes
and she probably likes Thai food.

1198
01:08:52,875 --> 01:08:56,375
Ellie is tied up and in danger,
and Chip is with her.

1199
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:58,875
It was Putty working
with Sweet Pete the whole time.

1200
01:08:58,958 --> 01:09:01,309
I cracked it. I'm coming, guys.

1201
01:09:07,375 --> 01:09:09,958
Come on.
Start, start, start, start!

1202
01:09:10,041 --> 01:09:12,541
No. No, no, no.

1203
01:09:16,875 --> 01:09:17,875
Huh.

1204
01:09:31,958 --> 01:09:35,625
Honey, someone's doing
a cool pose in the driveway.

1205
01:09:39,125 --> 01:09:43,583
Excuse me. Dale, old chum.
The sight of you lights my heart aglow.

1206
01:09:43,666 --> 01:09:45,708
Rangers, I need your help.

1207
01:09:45,791 --> 01:09:50,375
We love you, bud, but we just can't invest
in any more of your independent movies.

1208
01:09:50,458 --> 01:09:53,458
What... No, I'm not here for that.
I'm here for something very important.

1209
01:09:53,541 --> 01:09:56,291
Although that script was pretty good.
Did you even read it?

1210
01:09:57,458 --> 01:09:59,642
Chip, I wanna do something
extra special for you.

1211
01:09:59,666 --> 01:10:02,166
How would you feel
about playing your old character,

1212
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:06,041
but with feet for ears, and a dog snout
where your tail should be?

1213
01:10:06,166 --> 01:10:08,750
Okay, honest feedback,
that sounds terrible.

1214
01:10:08,833 --> 01:10:10,250
You're gonna like the way you look.

1215
01:10:10,333 --> 01:10:12,666
- I guarantee it.
- You'll never get away with this.

1216
01:10:12,833 --> 01:10:15,458
The Men's Wearhouse reference?
Yeah, I think I will.

1217
01:10:15,875 --> 01:10:18,208
Okay, let's make some changes.

1218
01:10:18,291 --> 01:10:20,291
Cook-a-rook-a-roo!

1219
01:10:20,416 --> 01:10:23,083
Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whee!

1220
01:10:23,166 --> 01:10:27,000
This is awesome!
I'm amazed this thing actually flies.

1221
01:10:27,083 --> 01:10:28,708
And you know how to fly it.

1222
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:31,125
Yeah. I guess my character
from the old show,

1223
01:10:31,208 --> 01:10:34,708
and my character in real life
are basically exactly the same.

1224
01:10:34,791 --> 01:10:37,833
Yeah, I guess so.
Zipper, how are the kids?

1225
01:10:37,916 --> 01:10:40,458
Splendid. I mean, sure,
being a stay-at-home dad

1226
01:10:40,541 --> 01:10:42,833
has its challenges,
but it's the most rewarding job

1227
01:10:42,916 --> 01:10:44,434
I could ever ask for and it just...

1228
01:10:44,458 --> 01:10:47,708
Whoa! It's actually my agent.
Sorry, can you hold on for a second?

1229
01:10:48,791 --> 01:10:52,083
Wow! Dave Bolinari.
Haven't heard from you in a while.

1230
01:10:52,166 --> 01:10:54,833
Did you not get my last seven years
of messages?

1231
01:10:54,916 --> 01:10:57,833
Oh, Daley, brother, so sorry.

1232
01:10:57,916 --> 01:11:00,750
Look, I got a new assistant,
and then we were off for the holidays.

1233
01:11:00,833 --> 01:11:03,208
Anyways, I'm watching the news.

1234
01:11:03,291 --> 01:11:06,375
You're the talk of the town.
We've got heat. We've got offers.

1235
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:09,456
I'm thinking book deal.
I'm thinking reboot.

1236
01:11:09,541 --> 01:11:12,083
Hey, actually, can I call you back?
I can't talk now.

1237
01:11:12,166 --> 01:11:15,333
What? But, Dale, you gotta get
your priorities straight, dawg.

1238
01:11:15,416 --> 01:11:17,583
You know what?
I think for the first time in my life,

1239
01:11:17,666 --> 01:11:19,666
I am getting my priorities straight.

1240
01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:23,666
Friends are more important
than business.

1241
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:25,750
- Dale, brother.
- Good for you, Dale.

1242
01:11:25,833 --> 01:11:27,875
Probably shouldn't have
thrown your phone, though.

1243
01:11:27,958 --> 01:11:29,750
Nope. Immediately regretted it.

1244
01:11:29,916 --> 01:11:31,851
Well, it was a good run.

1245
01:11:31,875 --> 01:11:34,750
- No, it wasn't. Who am I kidding?
- Okay, let's see.

1246
01:11:34,833 --> 01:11:37,416
Dog snout right on the butt.

1247
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:39,875
It's hilarious. Chip doesn't know
what he's talking about.

1248
01:11:41,458 --> 01:11:43,625
Stop him, Captain!
You're better than this.

1249
01:11:43,708 --> 01:11:44,833
No, I'm not.

1250
01:11:45,666 --> 01:11:49,333
Ah, there it is.
The foreboding fortress on the horizon.

1251
01:11:49,416 --> 01:11:53,208
- Oh, I love it when you talk fancy, honey.
- Thank you, my love.

1252
01:11:53,291 --> 01:11:55,333
- Aw.
- Looks like the only way in

1253
01:11:55,416 --> 01:11:59,458
- is through that exhaust pipe.
- Okay, good. Try to line me up with it.

1254
01:11:59,541 --> 01:12:03,708
- Are you sure you wanna do this, Dale?
- As sure as I've ever been.

1255
01:12:03,791 --> 01:12:06,916
But you're, like, known
for constantly making terrible decisions.

1256
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:11,458
- I know, right?
- Rescue Rangers, away.

1257
01:12:18,625 --> 01:12:20,666
Huh. At least that's gone.

1258
01:12:20,791 --> 01:12:26,958
Whoo! Hold on, Chippy!

1259
01:12:28,333 --> 01:12:31,791
Uh-oh.

1260
01:12:53,791 --> 01:12:57,208
- No! No, no, no, no. Come on!
- Hey, hey. Fix that.

1261
01:12:57,291 --> 01:12:59,875
- You should fix it.
- Oh, yeah. Thanks for the input, genius.

1262
01:13:00,166 --> 01:13:02,333
- Ellie.
- Dale.

1263
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:04,666
Hey, are you okay? Where's Chip?

1264
01:13:04,833 --> 01:13:06,833
- He's still in the machine.
- Over here.

1265
01:13:07,166 --> 01:13:08,958
- Chip, you're okay.
- Yeah.

1266
01:13:09,125 --> 01:13:11,541
You came for us.
I never doubted you, buddy.

1267
01:13:13,208 --> 01:13:16,500
- See? He understood the clue.
- Of course, it was obvious.

1268
01:13:16,666 --> 01:13:20,750
In "When You Fish Upon a Star,"
Gadget was double-crossed. Just like us.

1269
01:13:20,875 --> 01:13:22,916
Right. Totally.

1270
01:13:23,041 --> 01:13:24,726
You had a completely
different take, didn't you?

1271
01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:28,875
- Yes, mine involved Thai food.
- Stop! Or I'll erase him right here.

1272
01:13:28,958 --> 01:13:31,583
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay.
- Wait.

1273
01:13:31,666 --> 01:13:35,833
- Let's talk about this.
- Listen, I get how you feel.

1274
01:13:35,916 --> 01:13:38,041
Things didn't work out
the way you wanted, right?

1275
01:13:38,333 --> 01:13:41,458
You had big hopes and dreams and,
well...

1276
01:13:42,041 --> 01:13:44,250
...then the world
just sort of breaks your heart.

1277
01:13:44,750 --> 01:13:49,500
And it feels like the only emotions
you have left are anger and loneliness.

1278
01:13:50,208 --> 01:13:53,375
But you're not alone. None of us are.

1279
01:13:53,708 --> 01:14:00,583
Wow. It's true. You two really are
the worst actors in Hollywood.

1280
01:14:01,708 --> 01:14:03,541
Hey! What the... No!

1281
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:07,000
What the...

1282
01:14:10,833 --> 01:14:12,333
What is going on with this thing?

1283
01:14:19,083 --> 01:14:20,750
No, no, no. No!

1284
01:14:38,041 --> 01:14:39,708
That was not cool.

1285
01:14:40,708 --> 01:14:44,041
- Hey, are you okay?
- I think so.

1286
01:14:44,583 --> 01:14:46,958
- Dale, are you hurt?
- No, I'm good.

1287
01:14:52,208 --> 01:14:54,125
Huh?

1288
01:14:58,541 --> 01:15:00,000
Uh-oh. Hey!

1289
01:15:02,166 --> 01:15:03,166
Oh.

1290
01:15:05,833 --> 01:15:06,958
Oh.

1291
01:15:07,333 --> 01:15:09,666
Ugh! And it smells too.

1292
01:15:09,875 --> 01:15:14,750
Stupid glass. Okay, I'm out.

1293
01:15:14,916 --> 01:15:17,125
- Putty, he's getting away.
- I'm on it.

1294
01:15:34,208 --> 01:15:35,333
Meow.

1295
01:15:35,416 --> 01:15:38,125
- Huh?
- I'm gonna wreck stuff.

1296
01:15:38,208 --> 01:15:40,208
Run!

1297
01:15:47,291 --> 01:15:50,166
Hey, up here.

1298
01:15:51,291 --> 01:15:52,500
You fools!

1299
01:15:56,416 --> 01:15:57,833
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

1300
01:16:05,916 --> 01:16:08,208
Uh...

1301
01:16:08,291 --> 01:16:10,958
- Where are we?
- Boh Barba.

1302
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:14,291
Pooj, The Fat Honey Bear? Ugh.

1303
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,083
Keep going!

1304
01:16:18,166 --> 01:16:20,583
Two words. Chipmunk soup.

1305
01:16:22,250 --> 01:16:24,416
I guess they were making
the bootleg movies here

1306
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:25,700
- the whole time.
- What the...

1307
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:27,500
- Not overseas.
- Boy! Dorf!

1308
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:29,666
Ay, pechanga!

1309
01:16:37,583 --> 01:16:38,583
Captain?

1310
01:16:46,625 --> 01:16:49,875
It's all over. Just give yourself up.

1311
01:16:51,791 --> 01:16:54,875
Hello?

1312
01:16:55,041 --> 01:16:57,000
Whoa!

1313
01:16:57,083 --> 01:16:58,541
Whoa!

1314
01:16:58,625 --> 01:17:01,083
Oopsie daisy. Yo ink, yo ink.

1315
01:17:07,166 --> 01:17:08,750
Heads-up.

1316
01:17:11,125 --> 01:17:13,208
Oh, that actually made me dizzy.

1317
01:17:14,625 --> 01:17:18,125
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Watch out.

1318
01:17:19,291 --> 01:17:23,041
Hey, get outta the way,
you little yahoos! Move it!

1319
01:17:23,916 --> 01:17:25,708
You're messing things up here.

1320
01:17:26,125 --> 01:17:27,583
Coming through!

1321
01:17:28,458 --> 01:17:29,500
Grab on.

1322
01:17:30,416 --> 01:17:32,958
Whoa!

1323
01:18:04,375 --> 01:18:05,625
Yoo-hoo!

1324
01:18:05,708 --> 01:18:08,125
So close.

1325
01:18:08,208 --> 01:18:11,250
Okay.

1326
01:18:12,083 --> 01:18:15,208
You know, I'm...

1327
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:20,333
Ah, it's stuck to my face like
Silly Putty. Remember that stuff?

1328
01:18:20,416 --> 01:18:22,958
Let's finish this.

1329
01:18:24,666 --> 01:18:26,791
Boing!

1330
01:18:38,833 --> 01:18:43,083
Poor, sweet, little Ellie.
You never should've been a cop

1331
01:18:43,166 --> 01:18:44,333
in the first place.

1332
01:18:44,458 --> 01:18:49,000
Any last words? What? I can't hear you.
No? Okay. Bye, bye, you're dead.

1333
01:19:03,250 --> 01:19:06,958
Hey, Putty. Don't be so fragile.

1334
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:19,750
- No!
- There's nowhere to go.

1335
01:19:19,833 --> 01:19:20,875
We're trapped.

1336
01:19:21,041 --> 01:19:24,041
I'm gonna find you!

1337
01:19:24,166 --> 01:19:28,125
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

1338
01:19:28,208 --> 01:19:29,750
This is bad. Come on.

1339
01:19:29,875 --> 01:19:31,833
Use that big old brain of yours,
Chip, think.

1340
01:19:40,750 --> 01:19:41,750
That's it.

1341
01:19:41,833 --> 01:19:43,375
- Episode 325.
- Episode 325.

1342
01:19:43,916 --> 01:19:48,333
- Here. It worked on Fat Cat. Hit me.
- No. This time you hit me.

1343
01:19:48,416 --> 01:19:50,583
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Come on.

1344
01:19:51,250 --> 01:19:55,166
- Get right under it. Now, do it.
- Okay, here I go.

1345
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:56,916
Ow!

1346
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,500
I can't believe we used
to do this to you every week.

1347
01:19:59,625 --> 01:20:01,500
Come on, where are they?

1348
01:20:04,541 --> 01:20:07,000
Oh, come on, Harold.
It's the middle of the night.

1349
01:20:07,083 --> 01:20:09,416
- Just ignore it.
- We've been through this, Eileen.

1350
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:11,291
It's my job. Do not ruffle me right now.

1351
01:20:11,375 --> 01:20:14,125
- It didn't work. You gotta hit me again.
- All right.

1352
01:20:14,208 --> 01:20:16,416
Ow!

1353
01:20:16,625 --> 01:20:19,625
There you are.

1354
01:20:19,708 --> 01:20:22,291
Enough playing around.
My turn. Here, give it a good whack.

1355
01:20:22,375 --> 01:20:23,791
Oh!

1356
01:20:23,875 --> 01:20:26,958
Okay. Things are getting weird.

1357
01:20:34,041 --> 01:20:35,708
This isn't good.

1358
01:20:38,791 --> 01:20:40,583
Huh?

1359
01:20:40,666 --> 01:20:43,208
Birds. Come here!

1360
01:20:43,333 --> 01:20:44,958
Go! Go! Go!

1361
01:20:45,041 --> 01:20:47,250
What the...

1362
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:51,083
Almost there.

1363
01:20:57,791 --> 01:21:00,000
Goodbye, Chip 'n Dale.

1364
01:21:00,125 --> 01:21:01,458
Huh?

1365
01:21:01,541 --> 01:21:03,500
This is the FBI.

1366
01:21:03,583 --> 01:21:07,458
- We've got you surrounded.
- Yeah. Ugly Sonic!

1367
01:21:07,541 --> 01:21:10,291
Take that!

1368
01:21:10,666 --> 01:21:14,375
- Go, go, go, go. Come on, Dale. Hit it.
- Got it!

1369
01:21:15,833 --> 01:21:20,166
Huh?

1370
01:21:24,166 --> 01:21:26,708
- Yeah!
- Yes!

1371
01:21:26,791 --> 01:21:30,375
See! I told you
I had a show, Dale.

1372
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:33,750
Ow! Stupid teeth,
I think I just bit my tongue.

1373
01:21:33,833 --> 01:21:37,500
Whoo! We're the smartest chipmunks
on the planet.

1374
01:21:46,333 --> 01:21:48,791
- You thought you could beat us?
- Ha!

1375
01:21:49,208 --> 01:21:50,666
Don't you know who we are?

1376
01:21:50,916 --> 01:21:53,226
-Ch... Ch... Ch... Chip 'n Dale
-Ch... Ch... Ch... Chip 'n Dale

1377
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:54,666
-Rescue Rangers
-Rescue Rangers

1378
01:21:54,791 --> 01:21:56,642
-Chi... Chi... Ch... Chip and Dale
-Chi... Chi... Ch... Chip and Dale

1379
01:21:56,666 --> 01:21:58,101
-When there's danger
-When there's danger

1380
01:21:58,125 --> 01:21:59,750
-No, no, it never fails
-It never fails

1381
01:21:59,875 --> 01:22:01,635
-Once they're involved
-Once they're involved

1382
01:22:01,833 --> 01:22:04,833
Somehow whatever's wrong gets solved

1383
01:22:04,916 --> 01:22:09,666
Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers

1384
01:22:09,833 --> 01:22:14,250
No!

1385
01:22:21,583 --> 01:22:24,601
- Down! Get down on the ground!
- All right, all right, Calm down.

1386
01:22:24,625 --> 01:22:25,791
Dale?

1387
01:22:26,041 --> 01:22:28,333
D... Dale, come on. Don't mess with me.

1388
01:22:28,708 --> 01:22:31,208
Come on. Not this time, man.

1389
01:22:31,750 --> 01:22:37,375
I know you're just pranking me.
I'm not falling for this twice. Come on.

1390
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Dale?

1391
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:49,041
You... you know, the morning I met you,
when we were just kids at the cafeteria...

1392
01:22:50,375 --> 01:22:54,125
I never told you this, but I begged my mom
to let me stay home from school

1393
01:22:54,250 --> 01:22:56,958
because I didn't have any friends.

1394
01:22:57,833 --> 01:22:59,583
You're a great kid, Chip.

1395
01:23:00,625 --> 01:23:04,375
Remember, the biggest risk
is not taking any risk at all.

1396
01:23:05,125 --> 01:23:08,291
You'll find a friend. I promise.

1397
01:23:08,875 --> 01:23:13,666
I was so scared and alone.
And I was lost.

1398
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:15,833
Just like you, Dale.

1399
01:23:16,583 --> 01:23:20,833
And I needed you more than you needed me.

1400
01:23:21,208 --> 01:23:23,708
Hey. Mind if I sit?

1401
01:23:24,583 --> 01:23:28,333
All these years, I... I let you feel
like you were second bananaa

1402
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:31,833
because I wanted
to feel like first banana.

1403
01:23:32,416 --> 01:23:34,166
I was nothing without you.

1404
01:23:35,166 --> 01:23:38,083
So that night when...
In the trailer when... when you told me

1405
01:23:38,166 --> 01:23:41,541
about Double-0 Dale,
I... I just should have told you that.

1406
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:44,791
I shouldn't have treated you that way.

1407
01:23:45,708 --> 01:23:49,291
I'm sorry, Dale.

1408
01:23:52,875 --> 01:23:55,958
- Really?
- Dale!

1409
01:23:56,375 --> 01:23:59,375
- But how'd you...
- This thing's too special to throw away.

1410
01:23:59,833 --> 01:24:03,750
- Ow! That pog smashed my nose.
- That worked out well.

1411
01:24:03,916 --> 01:24:06,166
- You saved my life.
- Eh.

1412
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:08,041
You'd do the same for me.

1413
01:24:08,166 --> 01:24:10,583
Wait. Hold on a second.

1414
01:24:10,666 --> 01:24:12,916
If they were filming
the bootleg movies here,

1415
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,000
you don't think...

1416
01:24:14,541 --> 01:24:15,541
- Monty!
- Monty!

1417
01:24:33,708 --> 01:24:37,666
- Whoa. Okay, okay. Slow down.
- Do you see him?

1418
01:24:39,666 --> 01:24:41,000
Monty?

1419
01:24:41,083 --> 01:24:42,083
I don't see him.

1420
01:24:42,750 --> 01:24:43,750
Monty?

1421
01:24:55,583 --> 01:24:58,291
- Mates!
- Oh, Monty!

1422
01:24:58,666 --> 01:25:01,291
- We thought we lost you.
- Oh, thank goodness.

1423
01:25:01,375 --> 01:25:04,000
- You never gave up on me.
- Of course not.

1424
01:25:04,250 --> 01:25:07,875
- We'd never give up on friends.
- Oh, what did they do to you?

1425
01:25:08,166 --> 01:25:10,916
Ah, Chipper. They Dumbo'd me.

1426
01:25:11,041 --> 01:25:13,875
Don't worry. I've got a guy
that'll fix those ears, no problem.

1427
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,250
Oh, thank you, Dale.

1428
01:25:15,333 --> 01:25:19,916
- No way. Is that...
- Wow, those ears are huge.

1429
01:25:20,125 --> 01:25:23,583
Gadget, Zipper. I must be dreaming.

1430
01:25:26,291 --> 01:25:30,166
Can you believe it?
All the Rescue Rangers together.

1431
01:25:30,583 --> 01:25:34,291
It has been a long time.
It's really good to see you guys.

1432
01:25:34,375 --> 01:25:39,250
- It is wonderful to see you all.
- Wow, look at what you guys did.

1433
01:25:47,083 --> 01:25:49,083
You're under arrest,

1434
01:25:49,166 --> 01:25:52,666
you low-rent Gumby. He's all yours, boys.

1435
01:25:52,833 --> 01:25:55,875
Nice work on this case.
The FBI could use someone like you.

1436
01:25:55,958 --> 01:25:59,583
Thanks. But I think I'd like to start
my own detective agency.

1437
01:26:00,041 --> 01:26:02,500
Hey, Ellie, get over here.

1438
01:26:03,750 --> 01:26:07,000
Gang. I'd like you to meet
our dear friend, Ellie.

1439
01:26:07,083 --> 01:26:08,892
None of this would have been
possible without her.

1440
01:26:08,916 --> 01:26:13,750
- As it turns out, she's a...
- Fan. I am a huge fan.

1441
01:26:13,833 --> 01:26:15,125
Well, nice to meet you.

1442
01:26:15,208 --> 01:26:16,750
- Hello.
- Greetings.

1443
01:26:16,833 --> 01:26:20,916
You know, Dale, I'm sorry it took all this
to get us back together.

1444
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,250
Oh, Chip. Come here.

1445
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:27,125
Crikey. I'd cry if they didn't erase
me tear ducts.

1446
01:26:27,208 --> 01:26:30,708
To err is human, to forgive, divine.

1447
01:26:30,833 --> 01:26:33,666
Sometimes, I can't tell
what you guys like more.

1448
01:26:33,791 --> 01:26:40,000
Eating nuts or driving us nuts.

1449
01:26:41,666 --> 01:26:46,166
I've always wanted to do
one of these laughs with you guys.

1450
01:26:46,291 --> 01:26:51,041
- How long does it last?
- The worse the joke, the longer the laugh.

1451
01:26:57,666 --> 01:27:01,750
So, Chip. Does this mean
we are officially friends again?

1452
01:27:01,833 --> 01:27:05,083
Heh. Sure. I guess some things
are worth rebooting.

1453
01:27:05,166 --> 01:27:07,833
You said it.
You wanna do a Rescue Rangers reboot.

1454
01:27:07,958 --> 01:27:10,125
No, I didn't.
That is not what I meant.

1455
01:27:10,208 --> 01:27:12,583
I mean, maybe.
I'd have to see the script first.

1456
01:27:12,666 --> 01:27:16,083
Oh, yes. That's a yes.
Hey, do you think we can get,

1457
01:27:16,166 --> 01:27:18,392
- like, a pop star to do the theme song?
- Yeah, right.

1458
01:27:18,416 --> 01:27:22,416
Like a super serious version, even though
everyone just wants to hear the original.

1459
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:24,375
Yes! That exactly.

1460
01:27:27,708 --> 01:27:29,250
Sometimes

1461
01:27:29,541 --> 01:27:33,958
Some crimes
Go slipping through the cracks

1462
01:27:34,541 --> 01:27:38,833
But these two gumshoes

1463
01:27:39,333 --> 01:27:41,958
Are picking up the slack

1464
01:27:42,041 --> 01:27:45,583
There's no case too big
No case too small

1465
01:27:45,833 --> 01:27:50,708
-When you need help just call
-Ch... Ch... Ch... Chip 'n Dale

1466
01:27:50,916 --> 01:27:53,708
-Rescue Rangers
-Ch... Ch... Ch... Chip 'n Dale

1467
01:27:53,791 --> 01:27:57,583
-When there's danger
-No, no, it never fails

1468
01:27:57,708 --> 01:28:02,958
Once they're involved
Somehow whatever's wrong gets solved

1469
01:28:03,125 --> 01:28:07,666
