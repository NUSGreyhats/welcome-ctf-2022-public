# double

### Challenge Details
This challenge involves ciphertext that has been encoded into base64 and put through a rail fence cipher

### Key Concepts
- Encoding
- Transposition in cryptography (rail fence cipher)

### Solution

1. The given string `Z2h7TnJpNHQ1aW5yeWFzN2FzME1UMF9OX3JOcFM3T31ldFJGNE5kNDBJ` is encoded in base64
2. Decoding it gives `gh{Nri4t5inryas7as0MT0_N_rNpS7O}etRF4Nd40I`, which has been encrypted with the rail fence cipher
3. Decoding that gives the flag 

### Learning Objectives
How to recgonise a common encoding format (base64) and identify transpositioned ciphertexts

### Flag
